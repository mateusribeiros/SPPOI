apps or in-home displays. Such comparisons can motivate residents
to adopt more efficient behaviours.
Automation streamlines energy-saving practices by pre-setting
routines and making dynamic adjustments. Pre-set routines automate energy-saving behaviours based on learned patterns. For
instance, lights can be programmed to turn off automatically when
a room is unoccupied, or heating systems can lower the temperature during the night. Dynamic adjustments involve real-time
changes based on sensor data, such as automatically cooling a room
that becomes too warm or dimming lights when no one is in the
room. These automated interventions reduce the need for manual
adjustments and ensure continuous energy efficiency.
Incentives encourage residents to adopt sustainable behaviours
through rewards and goal-setting. Reward programs offer tangible
benefits for reduced energy consumption, such as discounts on utility bills, points redeemable for eco-friendly products, or community
recognition. Goal setting involves encouraging residents to set and
achieve energy-saving targets, with smart home systems tracking
progress towards these goals and providing positive reinforcement,
fostering a sense of accomplishment and promoting sustainable
practices.
Nudges are subtle environmental prompts or changes that encourage sustainable behaviours without being intrusive. Environmental cues, such as placing reminders to turn off lights or using
energy-efficient modes on appliances, nudge residents towards
