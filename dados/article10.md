Title: Secure Robotics: Navigating Challenges at the Nexus of
Safety, Trust, and Cybersecurity in Cyber-Physical Systems

The growing pervasiveness of robotic and embodied artificial intelligence systems in daily life and within
cyber-physical environments highlights a complex web of challenges at the intersection of robotic safety,
human-to-robot trust, and cybersecurity. This article explores these challenges by emphasising the crucial
role ofsecurity in establishing and maintaining trust between humans and robots, which isintegral to successfully adopting and operating these systems in human environments. Safety considerations include mitigating
the risks of physical harm and environmental damage due to robotic malfunctions or cyberattacks, particularly in autonomous robots requiring high built-in safety measures. From a cybersecurity perspective, these
systemsface unique challenges due to their complex, interconnected software and hardware componentsthat
necessitate robust protection against data breaches to ensure secure data communication. Additionally, the
dynamic interaction of these systems with the physical environment adds a layer of complexity, which makes
the safety, security, and reliability of these interactions a vital component of the overall security strategy. This
article reviews these areas within the cyber-physical systems paradigm by focusing on engineering fail-safe
mechanisms, the importance of trust and ethical responsibility in human-robot interactions, and the need
for resilient cybersecurity measures. At this nexus, a table of crossover challenges illustrates the intricacy of
integrating safety, trust, and security in robotic systems. This article introduces “secure robotics” as a new
paradigm to address these collective challenges with a novel model to provide a structured methodology for
evaluating and enhancing robotic system performance that symbolises the convergence of theoretical constructs with empirical analysis. By defining secure robotics, this article establishes a framework for advancing
roboticsin the cyber-physical era in alignment with current technological trends while anticipating future developments. This framework positions secure robotics as a key contributor to the evolution of cyber-physical
systems.

1 Introduction
The potentialrisks posed by cyberattacks on criticalsystems and sensitive information have grown
exponentially with the rapid and widespread adoption of information technology (IT) across
various domains. The recent surge of high-profile, significant breaches has resulted in substantial
financial and reputational losses while undermining public trust in these systems [1]. Cybersecurity, a multidisciplinary field encompassing diverse domains, seeks to develop comprehensive
strategies and state-of-the-art technologies to protect these systems and data from compromise
[2]. Over the years, the field of cybersecurity has continuously evolved and matured by adapting to the ever-changing threat landscape and addressing the increasing sophistication of cyber
adversaries [3–5].
Despite this increasing awareness of cybersecurity concerns, the literature has inadequately addressed the vulnerabilities and trust issues associated with robotics. Asrobotic and other embodied
and embedded artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been deployed in real-world settings, the
potential risks associated with these technologies have concurrently risen, which has highlighted
an urgent need for comprehensive scholarly attention to these critical areas [6, 7]. Cyber-physical
attacks on robotic systems, including offensive security attacks, pose a real threat to individuals’
and society’s safety, security, and privacy [8, 9].
Addressing these challenges necessitates understanding robotic systems’ unique characteristics to apply techniques and strategies to protect these systems from potential harm and thereby
establish and reinforce trust in robotic and embodied AI systems [10]. This approach involves
examining hardware and software vulnerabilities, securing communication protocols, preserving
privacy, and developing resilient AI algorithms [11, 12]. Additionally, it underscores the importance of understanding and mitigating the potential risks of offensive security attacks on robotic
systems [13].
This article investigates the intersecting spheres of cybersecurity, safety, and the trust humans
place in these systems to elucidate the current state of research and chart a course for future exploration. We collate and analyse a broad range of literature on these interconnected domains while
focusing on how successfully implementing robust cybersecurity measuresin robotic deployments
can bolster trust in these systems while enhancing their overall system resilience within the user
community [6, 10].
Industry 4.0 presents new challenges and opportunities for testing Asimov’s laws of robotics
[14]. As robotic systems become more sophisticated and autonomous, evaluating their adherence
to these ethical principles is crucial to ensure they remain aligned with human values and foster
trust between human users and robotic systems [15]. Asimov’s laws prioritise human safety and
well-being, which emphasises the importance of designing robots that can seamlessly integrate
into human environments without causing harm or disrupting human activities [6].
A crucial thread we follow in this survey is the intricate relationship between trust and cybersecurity. Trust between humans and robots is not a binary concept—it is built and nurtured over
time. Thus, we propose that trust can be fostered and further developed by leveraging strong cybersecurity measures. We emphasise the undeniable importance of robust cybersecurity and trust
within robotic safety and security domains and how these interwoven factors can significantly
contribute to the broader discourse in the field [7, 8].
Beyond our primary focus, we draw on the relevant literature from adjacent fields, such as
human-robot interaction (HRI), the psychology of trust, and risk management. These disciplines provide valuable insights and add depth to our understanding of how various factors influence and shape human-robot trust within a cybersecurity context [16–18].
Nonetheless, we do not avoid discussing the importance of robotic safety, a topic closely interlinked with humans’ trust in robots. An essential part of forging this trust is to ensure robots
operate safely in all circumstances to mitigate the risks of physical harm to humans and damage
to the surrounding environment. The discussion on robotic safety naturally leads to exploring system vulnerabilities in hardware and software while determining how to address them to ensure
the safety of operations and security from potential cyber threats. By providing this multidisciplinary analysis, we aim to paint a comprehensive and detailed picture of the state-of-the-art in
the rapidly evolving landscape that combines safety, security, and trust in robotic systems. With
this article, we hope to provide a firm foundation for the community upon which future research
and development in this critical area can be built and expanded.
Industry 4.0 [19, 20] broadly encapsulates the impetus behind the increased robotic deployment
as expedited through a series of technological advancementsthatsignificantly hinge on the evolvement of how humans and machines interact. Developments of note include augmented-reality
systems [21], which entail superimposing virtual elements onto the physical world to augment
users’ sensory experiences and engagement with their surroundings. Such systems have been applied to industrial maintenance and assembly tasks, where augmented reality can improve training
efficiency, reduce errors, and increase worker satisfaction [22].
Anotherimportant development isthe better utilisation of touch interfaces and other hands-free
operating systems [23]. A further contributing factor is bandwidth innovations to transfer digital data to physically usable machinery [24]. These advancements facilitate the development and
orchestration of manufacturing networks geared towards mass customisation and penalisation, a
burgeoning trend within the contemporary consumer market.
The resultant examples include improvements in advanced robotics and rapid prototyping [25].
In particular, 3D-printing technology has evolved significantly to provide various opportunities
for the forest products industry [26]. Driven by Industry 4.0 factors, the proliferation of robotic
systems into societal domains allows for exploring human-robot trust. Aspects such as robot appearance, including anthropomorphism and embodiment, have been shown to impact trust and
attention in industrial HRIs [27]. Moreover, considering the safety of service robots in urban environments is crucial, as negative interactions can adversely affect human-robot trust [28].
Trust in automation can be fostered by designing systems for appropriate reliance [16]. Indeed,
transparency, predictability, and performance significantly determine trust between humans and
robots [29]. By understanding these factors, the design of robots can be tailored to promote trust
and acceptance among users, which can ensure that the benefits of Industry 4.0 and advanced
robotics are fully realised. A critical aspect of establishing fruitful relationships between human
beings and robotic systems hinges on enhancing trust. In the sphere of safeguarding robotics
with a focus on guaranteeing safety and cybersecurity, improvements in trust are of significant
interest [30].
Many definitions of trust have been developed in the HRI context. One definition posits trust
as the expectation by one entity that a second entity will not undertake actions detrimental to the
first’s well-being [31]. Alternatively, trust has been described as a conviction held by an individual that another party will behave in a way that reduces the individual’s exposure to risk when
outcomes are at stake [32]. A unifying aspect of these definitions is the inquiry into how closely a
robot’s actions and behaviours correspond with the interests of humans [33].
Trust in HRI is a multidimensional concept influenced by various factors, including the robot’s
appearance, behaviour, and performance [27, 29]. When considering the application of cybersecurity measures to ensure the safety of robotic systems, contemplating how these strategies may
impact the human-robot trust relationship is important. Hence, quantifying the relationship between cybersecurity and trust may be crucial in designing and developing robotic systems. This
metric can support the cultivation of trust and cooperation between humans and robots, which is
essential in an era where the ubiquity of robotics is escalating [16, 18]. By ensuring that robotic
systems are secure and operate safely in a manner that aligns with human expectations and wellbeing, we can foster trust and pave the way for more seamless human-robot collaborations.
HRIs generate events that offer valuable insights into the broader cultural impacts of deploying such systems, particularly related to trust [28]. Studying these events from the perspective
of safety and cybersecurity in robotics presents opportunities to categorise the effects of these
trust-stimulating incidents [16]. Using data from cybersecurity-related events within these robotic
systems allows the potential for understanding the intrinsic relationship between safety, trust, robustness, and the system’s users [18, 30].
Delving into the intricate nature of these relationships can highlight the contributions of safety
and cybersecurity in roboticsto developing trust between humans and robots, considering reliability, transparency, and user experience (UX) [27, 29, 34]. Moreover, understanding how individual
differences (e.g., personality traits, cultural background, and prior experiences) influence trust in
robotic systems can offer invaluable insights. Trust has been extensively studied in information
system (IS) research and has generally demonstrated positive implications across various domains.
Thissentiment was echoed by Pienta et al.[35], who highlighted the beneficial aspects of trust in IS.
Furthersupporting this view, variousstudies have explored trust in different contexts within the
IS sphere. For instance, Ba and Pavlou [36] provided evidence of the positive role of trust in electronic markets, while Sun [37] examined its impact within the e-commerce sector. Additionally,
Cyr et al.[38] effectively illustrated the significance of trust in website design, while Bapna et al.
[39] discussed its relevance in online social networks. Collectively, these studies underscored the
pivotal role of trust in shaping user perceptions and interactions within various IS environments.
Expanding on the groundwork established in the IS field detailed in the preceding discussion, a
significant research opportunity exists to explore cyber-physical systems (CPSs), which represent an interdisciplinary domain that integrates the dynamics of the physical world with the
computational capabilities of IS. The interplay of trust, as extensively illustrated across IS settings, including electronic markets [36], e-commerce [37], website design [38], and online social
networks [39], presents a unique lens through which to examine CPSs.
Building on the insights gleaned from these studies, research on CPSs can delve into how trust
dynamics, as observed in IS, can translate into environments where physical and digital elements
are deeply intertwined. For instance, IS trust paradigms can inform the development of secure
and reliable CPS architectures, where the integrity and reliability of digital and physical components are crucial. Furthermore, understanding trust in IS can enhance user interactions with CPSs,
particularly when user decision-making relies heavily on system recommendations or actions.
This research avenue opens up possibilities for a comprehensive analysis of trust transfer mechanisms between purely digitalsystems and those involving physical elements. This exploration can
yield valuable insights into designing and implementing more robust, user-centric CPSs in alignment with the evolving dynamics of trust in the digital age. By tailoring robotic systems’ safety
measures and cybersecurity protocols to these individual needs and expectations, diverse user
populations can foster heightened trust and acceptance [40]. Therefore, exploring these multifaceted relationships can fortify our understanding of how safety and cybersecurity shape trust and
robustness in robotics while illuminating ways to enhance the integration of robots into various
aspects of human life.
Several factors contribute to developing and maintaining trust between human users and robotic
systems, including performance, transparency, reliability, dependability, and the ability to recover
from failures [34]. Performance, for instance, is crucial in establishing trust, as users need to perceive the robot as capable of completing its assigned tasks effectively and efficiently [16]. Moreover,
transparency in robotic systems facilitates trust by providing insight into the robot’s decisionmaking processes and current state [18], which allows users to understand the rationale behind
the robot’s actions while enabling them to better predict and anticipate the robot’s behaviour. Additionally, reliability and dependability are essential aspects that users consider when trusting a
robot since users must be confident that the robotic system will consistently perform its intended
functions without unexpected errors or failures [17].
Furthermore, a robot’s ability to recover from failures and adapt to unforeseen situations contributes to trust by demonstrating resilience and adaptability in facing challenges [11]. Cybersecurity has emerged as a key challenge in robotic system design and implementation. For instance,
Dutta and Zielińska (2021) discussed leading design challenges and offered a robotic system design methodology emphasising cybersecurity [12]. They argued that the design of robotic systems
must focus on performance and functionality while including resilience against cyber threats. In
this context, resilience pertains to a robotic system’s ability to uphold its functionality and performance levels in the face of potential cyber threats. These attacks can range from data breaches to
more severe attacksthat aim to disrupt or entirely halt the robot’s operations. Therefore, a resilient
robot must resist such attacks or recover quickly and efficiently if an attack is successful.
Trust in a robotic system may be enhanced when the system is perceived as resilient against
cyber threats. This trust comes not solely from the human operators of the robot but also from
any entities or systems that interact with it. A robot that can maintain its performance despite
potential cyber threats provides confidence in its reliability and integrity.
However, achieving this level of resilience and trust involves integrating security measures
throughout the robotic systems’ design and development process rather than treating security as
an afterthought or a separate component. Hence, Dutta and Zielińska proposed a design methodology to embed security considerations into each stage of the robotic system’s development, from
initial conceptualisation to deployment and operation [12].
This integrative approach to security aims to create a systemic and proactive defence against
cyber threats, which can allow the robotic system to anticipate potential risks, react accordingly,
and ensure continuous, secure operation. In this way, cybersecurity becomes an inherent feature
of the robotic system that contributesto its overall robustness and fostering trust among its human
users and other interacting systems [12].
Thus, in the evolving robotics landscape, a greater emphasis on cybersecurity in the design
methodology can pave the way for more resilient and trustworthy robotic systems capable of
safely integrating into various operational environments. A meta-analysis by Hancock et al. [34]
demonstrated that factors like performance, reliability, and transparency affect HRI trust. In line
with these findings, Morante et al. [10] suggested that effective communication between humans
and robots is essential for fostering trust. Furthermore, Desai and Kaniarasu [41] highlighted the
implications of robot malfunctions and feedback on trust in real time, which emphasised the need
for robust and reliable robotic systems.
Safety-critical advanced robots must be designed with trust in mind while incorporating appropriate reliance on automation [16]. For example, the integrative model of organisational trust
proposed by Mayer et al. [17] can be adapted to human-robot interaction by providing a comprehensive framework for understanding and fostering trust in robotic systems. In this context,
addressing the leading challenges of cybersecurity in robotic systems [12] is essential to ensuring a secure and trustworthy environment for HRI. Ergo, this paper introduces a comprehensive
framework for enhancing cybersecurity in robotic and embodied AI systems.
With robotic systems becoming increasingly complex and autonomous, addressing the elements
of cybersecurity is paramount to ensure these systems’ safety and effectiveness in HRIs. As noted
in previous discussions, understanding and addressing the various factors influencing trust in
such interactions is crucial [33]. Therefore, implementing thorough cybersecurity measures, addressing hardware and software vulnerabilities, and deploying resilient AI algorithms are vital to
protecting these robotic systems. Secure communication protocols and privacy-preserving techniques can safeguard sensitive data and maintain system integrity [11]. These measures are critical
in fostering a relationship of trust between humans and robots that can bolster the system’s robustness and resilience against cyber threats.
Moreover, a consciousfocus on safety and security measuresin robotics can aid in theirseamless
integration into human environments while encompassing several dimensions, from the physical
safety and reliability of the robot to the protection of data and user privacy. The ability of a robot
to operate safely and securely in human-centred environments is a fundamental determinant of its
acceptance and trustworthiness. By emphasising these considerations, we pave the way for developing and deploying safe, secure robotic systems that human counterparts trust and accept well.
In contemporary times, robotic systems are often deployed in unsecured configurations, which
leaves them vulnerable to cyberattacks [42]. This susceptibility becomes especially critical when
such systems are connected to wide-area networks, public internet infrastructure, or aggregated
information and communication systems. CPSs, which integrate computation, networking, and
physical processes, are becoming increasingly prevalent and further emphasise the need for robust
security measures in robotics [43].
At present, the intersection of cybersecurity and robotics—despite its growing importance—is
somewhat underrepresented within the broader field of roboticsresearch. This disparity highlights
the need for thorough research into how extensive cybersecurity protections impact the resilience
of robotic systems and foster trust in HRIs. With the escalating frequency of robotic system deployments and the rising significance of CPSs, confronting and mitigating the vulnerabilities of
these systems against potential malicious actions involving robots is critical [44].
This article investigates the complexities and potential threats that unsecured robotic and autonomous systems may pose to the generally accepted definitions of trust discussed previously. A
primary concern is that a robotic system compromised by a cyber threat may display behaviours
misaligned with human interests that disrupt essential trust between human users and the robot.
We explore the potential fallout of such a breach of trust and its repercussions on user acceptance,
system robustness, and overall system efficacy. Additionally, we delve into potential strategies for
preventing such breaches by enhancing cybersecurity measures, improving system resilience, and
fostering an environment of mutual trust between humans and robots.
A recent three-year review of the state of cybersecurity in robotics illuminated the inherent
vulnerability of currently deployed robotic systems. This area of study centres on fortifying the
relationship between humans and robots by identifying and addressing these vulnerabilities and
implementing robust cybersecurity measures in robotic systems [45]:
Several factors contribute to the prevailing insecure deployment practices of robotic systems.
First, defensive security mechanisms for robots are still in their infancy, failing to address the
comprehensive threat landscape. Second, the inherent complexity of robotic systems renders their
protection technically and economically challenging. Third, vendors often fail to assume responsibility in a timely manner, thereby prolonging the exposure window for zero-day vulnerabilities—
those unknown to those who would be interested in mitigating the vulnerability—to span several
years on average. Even worse, many manufacturers continually shift the responsibility for these
issues onto the end-users of these machines or completely disregard it. [45]
These key issues underscore the urgency of dedicated research and development effortsto fortify
cybersecurity measures in robotics. The objective is to guarantee secure and reliable interactions
between humans and robots, which entails addressing the technical intricacies of robotic systems,
formulating efficient defensive measures, and promoting responsible actions by all stakeholders
involved—from manufacturers to end-users. By strengthening cybersecurity practices and mechanisms in robotics, we seek to enhance system robustness while fostering a deeper level of trust
between humans and robots. This outcome can facilitate smoother human-robot collaborations to
maximise the potential benefits of robotic systems in various domains.
Given the critical importance of human-robot trust relationships [33], this article emphasises
the need to enhance trust factors, exploit engineering optimisation opportunities, and improve the
cybersecurity posture of deployed robotic systems by implementing established and novel cybersecurity controls. To this end, we propose a five-layer secure robotic control model and explore
the need for further research into the genesis and application of cybersecurity controls to improve human-robot trust factors [41]. Ergo, the article presents a comprehensive framework for
enhancing cybersecurity in robotic and embodied AI systems to address critical vulnerabilities
[46] and provide actionable recommendations for researchers and practitioners. By advancing our
understanding of security and trust in HRI, we can facilitate a more secure and collaborative future between humans and robots to ensure that robotic systems seamlessly integrate into human
environments without compromising safety and trust [16].
As the domain of robotics matures, the fusion of efforts from different fields becomes crucial in
constructing and applying robust security measures to enhance the relationship of trust between
humans and robots. This article aims to contribute to the existing compendium of knowledge by
scrutinising the challenges and opportunities that arise when ensuring the security and dependability of robotic systems in a progressively interconnected world [14]. Therefore, this article ventures further into the intricacies of securing robotic systems by drawing from previous dialogues
on the current state of cybersecurity in robotics, the importance of trust relationships between
humans and robots, and a proposed five-layer model for robotic control security.
A comprehensive framework aims to boost cybersecurity in robotics and embodied AI systems
by tackling critical vulnerabilities and providing practical suggestions for researchers and practitioners. We explore the intersection of safety, trust, and cybersecurity to illustrate how these three
aspects are intertwined. A cybersecurity breach can compromise the system’s safety and thereby
erode trust. Therefore, collectively addressing these elements is essential for enhancing robotic
systems’ overall robustness and trustworthiness.
Our objective is to chart the course towards a more secure and collaborative future between
humans and robots. We aim to nurture an environment where robotic systems can integrate effortlessly into human settings without undermining safety or trust. The ultimate goal is to ensure
that the substantial potential benefits of robotics can be fully realised without compromising the
well-being and security of individuals and society.

and safety vulnerabilities—central concerns in CPSs—may be addressed within a comprehensive
security framework tailored for robotic environments.
1.3 Positioning and Unique Contributions of this Survey
The key advantage of this survey is its rounded integration of trust, safety, and cybersecurity issues, which frames them as essential to secure robotics advancement. By simultaneously evaluating these factors, the survey reveals emergent patterns and critical security needs often underrepresented in broader CPS and robotics studies. This analysis illustrates how these challenges inform
the necessity forsecurity-by-design principles, adaptable defensive measures, and pre-emptive risk
mitigation strategies, particularly in high-stakessectorssuch as healthcare, autonomoustransport,
and industrial robotics. Such industry-focused insights provide practical guidance to researchers
and practitioners alike.
1.4 Emergence of the Secure Robotics Paradigm
The main contribution of this work is establishing secure robotics as a foundational paradigm
within CPS research and introducing the Composite Security Measurement Model. This model
provides a structured methodology for assessing and enhancing security across CPS environments
by offering a tangible framework for evaluating critical security elements. Through the conceptual mapping of the secure robotics paradigm and the detailed development of this measurement
model, the survey deepens theoretical understanding and equips industry stakeholders, developers, and researchers with tools for systematically addressing the unique security, trust, and safety
challenges inherent to CPSs.

the rapid progression of cyber threats and the rise of AI-driven autonomy in robotics, this work
calls for an adaptive approach to security frameworks, particularly those designed for autonomous
decision-making systems. The Composite Security Measurement Model furthersupportsfuture research by promoting multidisciplinary collaboration in refining secure robotics practices. These
insights position this survey as a key resource that bridges existing research with actionable security advancements to support the development of resilient and trustworthy CPS applications.
2 Background on Robotics and Cyber-Physical Systems
Robotics studies and creates systems to perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously by
integrating physical mechanisms, computational elements, and control functions. At its core, robotics encompasses the design, construction, and operational use of robots—machines capable
of executing tasks within structured and unstructured environments with minimal human intervention. Modern robotic systems are embedded with a suite of sensors, actuators, and advanced
processing capabilities, which enable them to perceive their surroundings, make decisions, and act
based on predefined algorithms or learned behaviours [47, 48].
CPSs are systems with computational elements with tightly integrated physical processes that
facilitate seamless real-time interactions between digital commands and physical outputs [43]. In
CPSs, software and hardware work in tandem to interface directly with the physical world while
often encompassing control theory, computational intelligence, and networked communication to
achieve robust and resilient system behaviour [43]. CPSs have been widely adopted across various
sectors, including manufacturing and healthcare, where reliability, safety, and adaptability are
essential [49].
The interconnection between robotics and CPSs lies in their shared reliance on embedded control systems and real-time feedback loops that facilitate interactions within dynamic environments. Robotic systems are a specialised subset of CPSs, where cyber elements (e.g., software,
algorithms, and processing) integrate seamlessly with physical components (e.g., sensors, motors,
and structural frameworks) to perform complex tasks [50, 51]. This integration is particularly crucial in applications involving autonomous and semi-autonomous robotic systems, where real-time
feedback and adaptive responses to environmental changes are essential for safe and effective
operation [52]. The CPS framework also heightens certain challenges in robotics—especially regarding security, safety, and trust—since vulnerabilities in cyber components can directly affect
these systems’ physical behaviours and safety [53].
The interconnected nature of robotics and CPSs emphasises the necessity of secure design and
resilient communication pathways, particularly in autonomous robotic systems operating in realworld environments. This relationship is grounded in foundational CPS principles (e.g., real-time
interaction, adaptive feedback mechanisms, and embedded control systems) that enable robots
to operate seamlessly within complex physical environments [50, 51]. The integration of CPS in
robotics further underscores the need for comprehensive security measures that mitigate cyber
vulnerabilities (e.g., weaknesses) that can have direct, potentially hazardous impacts on physical
safety and operational integrity [53].
Addressing these unique challenges within CPS-robotic systems positions secure robotics as a
pivotal field incorporating cybersecurity, trust, and safety principlesto foster reliable,secure applications. This approach is especially relevant when examining legacy robotic system vulnerabilities
that often lack the robust security infrastructure and resilience required in modern CPS-integrated
robotic applications.Asroboticssystems advance within the CPS framework,securing these legacy
systems against evolving threats has become evermore critical [52].
2.1 Legacy Robotic System Vulnerabilities
Examining how legacy robotic systems, as vital CPS components, are vulnerable to cyberattacks
and disruptions to their availability is crucial. Legacy robotics, often distinguished by outdated
hardware, software, and communication protocols, do not possess the necessary security features
to defend against modern cyber threats. This vulnerability renders them susceptible to adversaries
intent on exploiting weaknesses within high-risk environments, which can potentially compromise the integrity of the CPSs they encompass. [54]. Legacy robotics face security challenges like
legacy IT systems. The absence of contemporary security features, essential for protection against
modern cyber threats, has rendered these systems increasingly susceptible [54]. Consequently,
legacy robotics and IT systems are exposed to numerous vulnerabilities, so they are attractive
targets for cyber adversaries.
Moreover, older hardware components may have undiscovered security flaws that attackers
can exploit [45, 55]. These hardware vulnerabilities can stem from design flaws, manufacturing
defects, or even the use of counterfeit components in the supply chain. Such vulnerabilities can
lead to system crashes, data breaches, and unauthorised control ofrobotic systems, with potentially
severe consequences for safety and operational efficiency.
In addition to these hardware-related issues, [55] emphasised the importance of considering
software vulnerabilities. Legacy software, for example, often lacks regular updates and patches,
which leaves known security issues unaddressed. Similarly, older communication protocols may
not employ robust encryption or authentication techniques, which makes data transmissions and
system controls vulnerable to interception and tampering.
To mitigate the risks associated with outdated hardware components in robotic systems, [55]
recommended a combination of proactive measures, such as regular hardware maintenance, component upgrades, and hardware security features like secure storage and tamper resistance. Furthermore, the authors advocated for a holistic approach to robotic system security by considering
software and communication while implementing comprehensive cybersecurity policies and employee training programs to reduce the likelihood of successful cyberattacks. Indeed, many legacy
robotics systems rely on obsolete operating systems, which lack vendor support and are no longer
maintained [55]. Therefore, these systems lack the critical security updates necessary to protect
against newly discovered vulnerabilities.
Legacy communication protocols present another challenge due to the frequent use of insecure
data transmission and authentication [55]. Modern communication protocols employ robust encryption and authentication techniques to secure data transmissions and prevent unauthorised
access. However, legacy robotics systems may still use older, less secure protocols susceptible to
eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and other cyber espionage.
Yaacoub et al.’s [55] comprehensive study, “Robotics Cyber Security: Vulnerabilities, Attacks,
Countermeasures, and Recommendations”, explores the vulnerability surfaces affecting robotic
systems by paying particular attention to the challenges legacy robotics systems face due to outdated hardware components. These components often lack the necessary processing power or
memory capacity to support advanced security features (e.g., encryption, intrusion detection systems, and secure boot mechanisms) [44, 55]. As a result, these systems become susceptible to
cyberattacks and unauthorised access. Security issues in robotics are multifaceted and can exploit
any vulnerability or security gap to target robotic systems and applications [55].
The evolution of CPSs and robotics has ushered in groundbreaking advancements along with
critical challenges, particularly as these systems have expanded in autonomy and complexity.
While foundational CPS frameworks prioritise functionality and interoperability, they often lack
a security-first approach that exposes critical robotic applications to cyber threats. This security
gap is particularly concerning as CPS-robotics systems have been increasingly used in sensitive
areas such as autonomous vehicles and healthcare.
Real-time feedback loops, a cornerstone of CPSs, are essential for operational responsiveness
in robotics. However, implementing robust security measures without compromising real-time
performance remains a significant challenge. Current approaches have struggled to achieve this
balance effectively, which highlights the need for adaptive security mechanisms that maintain
responsiveness under varying threat conditions.
New vulnerabilities have emerged with the shift towards greater autonomy, particularly from
AI and machine learning integrations. Attacks like data poisoning and adversarial manipulation
specifically target autonomous decision-making, which demands a re-evaluation of traditional security practices within CPSs. Moreover, the current lack of regulatory alignment exacerbates these
challenges and creates inconsistencies in security practices across industries and regions. Bridging
this regulatory gap through standardised practices can enhance system resilience and ensure the
safe integration of CPSs in high-stakes environments.
2.2 Cybersecurity Challenges in Robotics
This article presents a table derived from the study “Robotics Cyber Security: Vulnerabilities,
Attacks, Countermeasures, and Recommendations”. The table overviews the challenges and vulnerabilities in robotics and embodied AI cybersecurity, which are pivotal because they influence
robotic systems’ safety, trustworthiness, and performance. This methodical compilation is crucial
for constructing a robust cybersecurity framework tailored to the distinctive needs of these systems. Organising and detailing these issues aims to give researchers, developers, and engineers a
more comprehensive understanding of potential weak points and areas requiring attention in the
design and implementation of robotic systems.
A deeper appreciation of these vulnerabilities can enable more effective and targeted countermeasures to improve the security posture of robotics and embodied AI. These countermeasures
and careful design considerations can enhance trust in and the safety of robotic systems to enhance the symbiotic relationship between humans and robots and ensure that robotic systems can
work effectively in their designated roles while being secure from potential threats. By understanding and addressing the intersection of safety, trust, and cybersecurity, we can mitigate risks
and foster an environment where robots can seamlessly integrate into human society to lay the
foundation for further advancements in the field while inspiring more innovations and solutions
to the complex problem of securing robotics and embodied AI systems.
The table also functions as a reference point throughout the article to enable readers to
quickly identify and recall specific challenges explored in more depth in subsequent sections.
This structured approach enhances the readability and comprehension of the article while facilitating the identification of potential solutions and strategies to mitigate the associated risks.
As a result, the table contributes significantly to the overall objective of the article: to establish a comprehensive framework for enhancing cybersecurity in robotic and embodied AI
systems.
As listed in Table 1, legacy robotic systems face numerous cybersecurity challenges that make
them vulnerable to various attacks. Insecure networking can compromise communication between
robots, machines, and humans, which exposes the system to cyberattacks. [55]. Insufficient authentication, which allows unauthorised access using easily breached usernames and passwords,
further exacerbates the issue [55].
Weak encryption algorithms result in a lack of confidentiality, which leads to the interception
and exposure ofsensitive robotic data and design plans[55]. Privacy concerns arise from the potential exposure of business deals, trades, and collaboration between different robotic security firms.
Additionally, compromised message authentication protocols can lead to weak integrity, which
allows the alteration of sensitive robotic data, whether stored or in transit [55].
Inadequate verification without robust biometric features can enable unauthorised access or
abuse of privilege, while authorisation issues may result in improper access control within robotic
labs, factories, and industries [55]. Misconfiguration and poor programming can compromise the
functionality and accuracy of robotic systems and threaten human operators and software features
[55]. The absence of tamper-resistant hardware makes robots prone to damage and partial/total
destruction, which leads to a loss of functional and operational capabilities [55].
Legacy robotic systems also lack self-healing processing, so they are vulnerable to cascading
attacks without the ability to recover orreact in time to prevent further degradation in performance
[55]. Insufficient safety designs can be lethal and threaten humans, which results in casualties,
fatalities, and financial losses. Additionally, the absence of security-by-design features can enable
attackers to exploit the robotic system’s architecture and design for further attacks, including
malicious data injection and modification [55].
Inadequate AI-based designs can negatively affect robots’ operational and functional performance when assigned a task, which compromises accuracy and performance [55]. A lack of updates for robotic operating systems, firmware, and software can result in various cyber-physical
attacks. Moreover, insufficiently advanced IDS solutions can leave systems vulnerable, particularly
when relying on systems that only detect anomalies, behaviours, or signature malware patterns
rather than advanced hybrid, lightweight, or AI-based IDS solutions [55].
The absence of penetration testing can lead to security breaches in deployed applications, while
a lack of security patches increases the likelihood of basic and advanced attacks (e.g., theft of

sensitive data, remote access, and rootkits) [55]. Insufficient personnel training leaves personnel
in coding robotic domains, human operators, IT, and executives vulnerable to social engineering,
reverse engineering, and phishing attacks[55]. Poor human-machine collaboration can potentially
affect human labour, work, and performance. Inadequate employee screening may result in insider
attacks by whistleblowers who leak sensitive data and expose classified information and sensitive
robotic details [55].
The cybersecurity landscape in robotics faces significant challenges due to weaknesses in foundational security mechanisms, including encryption, authentication, and access control. For instance, weak encryption algorithms can undermine data confidentiality and make sensitive robotic
data and proprietary designs vulnerable to interception by malicious actors [55]. Such vulnerabilities have significant implications for industries relying on robotics, as intercepted data may reveal
business-sensitive information like trade secrets and strategic partnerships. Additionally, compromised message authentication protocols can lead to weak data integrity that allows attackers
to alter critical robotic data at rest and in transit, which potentially results in malfunctions and
manipulations of robotic functions. Adopting robust cryptographic practices and enhanced data
integrity checks is essential to address these risks, particularly in sectors with strict confidentiality
requirements.
Furthermore, legacy robotic systems lacking security-by-design features often expose exploitable architectural weaknesses, which enables attackersto inject or modify data with malicious
intent. Often built without self-healing or tamper-resistant capabilities, these systems remain susceptible to physical damage and cascading failures during attacks, which highlights the need for
secure-by-design principles encompassing access control and resilience. Therefore, a comprehensive, quantitative cybersecurity strategy combining regular penetration testing, proactive security updates, and rigorous human resource protocols is essential for creating resilient and secure
robotic systems capable of withstanding internal and external threats.
2.3 Enhancing Human-Robot Trust Using Cybersecurity Measures
The subsequent sections examine the importance of the challenges presented in Table 1, explore
their intersection with trust and safety issues, and discuss how addressing them can enhance trust
between humans and robots. This trust is essential to ensuring smooth collaboration and efficient
functioning of human-robot teams in various industries and applications. By systematically addressing these challenges through experiments and proposed solutions, we aim to enhance robotic
systems’ overall security and reliability to facilitate a more trusting human-robot relationship.
This article seeks to provide a comprehensive framework for securing robotics and embodied
AI systems by exploring various methods, techniques, and solutions to address the challenges outlined in Table 1. By enhancing the security posture of these systems, we seek to mitigate the risks
associated with cyber-physical attacks while fostering a more trusting and collaborative relationship between humans and robots. This article also discusses developing and evaluating cybersecurity best practices and guidelines for implementing and maintaining secure robotic systems. By
offering a practical and actionable approach to enhancing the cybersecurity of these systems, the
research presented in this article seeksto significantly contribute to the ongoing effort to safeguard
robotics and embodied AI systems from emerging threats.
Later sections aim to determine whether legacy robotic systems, with limited or no cybersecurity rigour applied, negatively impact the human-robot trust relationship. A compromised robotic
system can pose risks to the safety and efficiency of operations while undermining users’ confidence in the reliability and security of the system. This outcome, in turn, can lead to reluctance or
hesitance in adopting and utilising robotic systems in various industrial and commercial settings.
Finally, the later sections of this article examine the implications of addressing these challenges in the human-robot trust relationship. We present a contextual example highlighting the
importance of robust cybersecurity measures in fostering trust and collaboration between humans and robots. By showcasing the benefits of improved security and trust, we hope to emphasise the necessity of continued research and development in this critical area. This work aims
to contribute to the ongoing effort to create more secure, reliable, and trustworthy robotic systems that lead to better human-robot collaboration and more efficient operations across various
domains.
2.4 Cyberattack Taxonomy in Cyber-Physical Systems
The study “Meta-Taxonomy, Review, and Applications of Cyberattack Taxonomies of Manufacturing Cybersecurity Threat Characteristics and Counteractive Measures” [56] provided a
meticulous and systematic exploration of various components of cyberattacks while spanning the
motivation behind them, potential implications, and corresponding countermeasures. Initially,
This figure categorises the various cybersecurity challenges robotic systems face when operating in diverse
environments. Each category highlights a specific threat vector (e.g., physical tampering, network attacks,
and software vulnerabilities) to illustrate how these challenges interact across operational contexts (e.g.,
industrial, healthcare, and public spaces). For instance, network-related threats are depicted as impacting data
confidentiality and communication integrity in interconnected environments, whereas physical tampering poses
a significant risk in isolated industrial settings. The taxonomy provides a structured overview for understanding
the multifaceted security landscape and supports the development of robust defensive strategies tailored to
different robotic applications [56].
this research scrutinised and dissected the prevailing taxonomical classifications associated
with manufacturing cybersecurity threats and counteractive measures while considering the
expanding scope and coverage of current taxonomies. The article used this foundation to discern
the shortcomings in existing attack taxonomies and offer suggestions for enhancements in future
iterations. Ultimately, the study proposed potential application scenarios for attack taxonomies
in intelligent manufacturing systems, including the assessment of security threats and related
risks, the development of risk mitigation strategies, and guidance in implementing cybersecurity
frameworks while considering the backdrop of CPSs.
Figure 1 presents a sample taxonomy that captures the diverse cybersecurity challenges unique
to robotic systems. The figure categorises these challenges into major themes (e.g., Network Vulnerabilities, Software Integrity, and Physical Tampering Risks) to demonstrate how these vectors
influence robotic performance and safety in varied settings. As depicted in Figure 1 and described
by Rahman et al. [56], the diagram highlights that in the context of an automated manufacturing
environment—which often involves robotics and CPSs—specific offensive approaches may call for
a simultaneous strike on various nodes (N1 and C1) through concurrent attacks (AV11 and AV21).
Conversely, some strategies may prefer to focus on a single target point (P1) using a unique
attack method (AV31). These observations offer valuable information that can aid in calculating
the success rate of an attack and the probability of eluding detection.
For instance, orchestrated attacks on diverse locations within the manufacturing value chain
may demand increased resource allocation and detection chances that escalate the adversaries’
attack expenses. Depending on their available resources and objectives, these adversaries may
exhibit diverse preferences in choosing the most effective attack route to optimise the inflicted
damage while minimising the detection probability. For manufacturers, this most effective adversary route signifies the presence of vulnerable assets and critical interconnections that require
immediate and prioritised protective measures. The figure above lays out a constructive cyberattack taxonomy pertinent to CPSs. Thus, in subsequent sections, this article seeks to amalgamate
this taxonomy with those established within robotic system safety and trust domains.
The research conducted in this article intends to serve as a valuable resource for researchers, developers, engineers, and stakeholders involved in robotics and embodied AI systems. The insights
gained from addressing the challenges listed in Table 1 and the proposed solutions can improve
these systems’ overall security and reliability while facilitating the development of a more trusting
human-robot relationship. As a result, we can enable the full potential of robotics and embodied
AI systems to ultimately lead to greater efficiency, productivity, and innovation in a wide range of
industries and applications.
Developing a comprehensive cyberattack taxonomy for CPSs underscores the complex nature
of securing systems that blend physical components with digital networks. This taxonomy categorises cyberattack types and highlights how certain attack methods (e.g., denial-of-service
[DoS] attacks) can directly impact physical operations by disrupting system stability and realtime control. The layered taxonomy helps delineate how threat actors may choose attack vectors
based on their impact potential across CPS operational levels. For instance, while network-based
attacks exploit communication vulnerabilities, data tampering attacks often undermine sensor fidelity, which poses significant risks to CPS reliability. This multi-tiered approach supports a nuanced understanding of CPS vulnerabilities, which demonstrates how certain categories of attacks
may uniquely exploit the real-time feedback and automated control loops that CPSs rely on for
synchronised operations.
A well-defined cyberattack taxonomy also provides a critical foundation for developing targeted defence strategies tailored to the CPS environment. By identifying the specific vulnerabilities within CPSs (e.g., insecure communication channels and vulnerable control software), this
taxonomy informs the design of layered security solutions that can pre-emptively mitigate these
risks. However, while the taxonomy captures a broad spectrum of attacks, the rapid evolution
of cyber threats, particularly those targeting autonomous decision-making and AI-driven functions within CPSs, suggests a need for continuous updates to the taxonomy. As CPS technologies
advance, adaptive defence mechanisms that evolve alongside the taxonomy will be essential to
safeguarding CPS networks from emerging threats.
2.5 Challenges to Human-Robot Trust
The relationship between human-robot trust and cybersecurity is poised to become increasingly
significant as robots and automation permeate various aspects of daily life, including industry,
healthcare, and personal environments [43, 54]. Trust is a foundational HRI aspect crucial in
robotic systems’ acceptance, adoption, and effectiveness [16, 17]. In HRI, trust is not only about
the robot’s functionality but also concerns its ability to communicate intentions and demonstrate
reliability in diverse, often unpredictable, scenarios.
Exploring trust within the context of HRI reveals that many principles of trustworthiness
originate from IS research, where trust is often associated with enhanced outcomes across digital
interactions. Studies on IS, such as in e-commerce and online social networks, have illustrated
how trust directly impacts user engagement and satisfaction [36, 37]. These IS insights can inform
HRI by highlighting design elements (e.g., transparency, reliability, and secure data practices) that
enhance user trust in robots and autonomous systems [57].
As robotics increasingly intersects with cybersecurity in CPSs, safeguarding trust becomes a
multifaceted challenge. CPSs integrate physical components with control software, which exposes them to potential cyber threats [58]. Cyberattacks, including DoS, replay, zero-dynamics,
and covert attacks, can destabilise these systems, which emphasises the need for robust security
measures [59]. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) highlights the importance of building CPSs that are resilient to cyber-physical threats through advanced attack detection, control, and mitigation strategies [58].
A challenge in fostering human-robot trust lies in designing robots that communicate their intentions and capabilities effectively. Integrating anthropomorphic features (e.g., familiar gestures
and social cues) can strengthen trust by creating a sense of connection between humans and robots
[27, 29]. However, over-reliance on anthropomorphic design may lead to overtrust, so users place
excessive confidence in robotic abilities, especially in high-stakes situations [40]. From a cybersecurity perspective, overtrust may result in users inadvertently disclosing sensitive information to
compromised systems (e.g., banking details and personally identifiable information).
Another challenge is ensuring the cybersecurity of robots and the CPSs they operate within, as
cyber threats can undermine trust by compromising the safety and functionality of these systems
[10, 46, 54]. Attack-resilient state estimation and model-robust approaches have been proposed to
enhance the cybersecurity of robotic networks [11]. Moreover, as robots become more integrated
into human lives, understanding the social and ethical implications of HRI (e.g., Asimov’s three
laws of robotics) becomes increasingly important [15].
Cybersecurity is critical in building and maintaining human trust in robotic systems. Robotic
systems’ increasing complexity and connectivity make them vulnerable to a wide range of cyber
threats [55]. Cybersecurity breaches in robotics can lead to unauthorised access, the manipulation
or control of data, and physical harm to humans or the environment [45]. Such incidents can
dampen humans’ trust in robotic systems, which ultimately limitstheir effectiveness and adoption.
A robust cybersecurity framework is essential for mitigating potential threats and fostering trust
in robotic systems. Secure design principles, regular security assessments, and continuous monitoring are necessary to identify vulnerabilities and implement robust countermeasures akin to
IT system security. In addition to technological safeguards, creating awareness and training users
on the importance of cybersecurity in HRI can contribute to building and maintaining trust [60].
One of the critical aspects of the relationship between human-robot trust and cybersecurity is
the concept of overtrust [61], which occurs when users rely excessively on robotic systems, which
leads to underestimating or overlooking potential security risks. Overtrust can make users more
vulnerable to cyberattacksthat jeopardise theirsafety and the system’s overall security. To address
overtrust, researchers and developers must focus on designing transparent and explainable robotic
systems that allow users to better understand their capabilities and limitations while providing
clear feedback on system status and potential threats [62].
The relationship between human-robot trust and cybersecurity is a vital aspect of HRI. Ensuring robust cybersecurity in robotic systems helps build and maintain trust, which is crucial for
effectively collaborating and adopting these technologies. A balance is needed in fostering trust in
robotic systems and avoiding overtrust, as both factors are essential for the safe and effective use of
robots in various domains. As robotics advances and integrates into our daily lives, the interplay
between trust and cybersecurity will remain a critical area of focus for researchers, developers,
and end-users [63].

As we delve deeperinto the era ofrobotics and automation, a multidimensional understanding of
trust, safety, and cybersecurity becomes paramount. Robots are becoming increasingly integrated
into various aspects of our lives, which makes establishing and maintaining trust essential for
effective collaboration and widespread acceptance of these technologies. This article delves into
the intricate connections between the trust placed in robotics by humans, the safety these systems
must ensure, and the cybersecurity challenges they must overcome.
A central contribution of this work lies in identifying and comprehensively analysing the principal challenges that directly influence the trust humans place in robotic systems. We dissect the
impact of cybersecurity on this trust by detailing how breaches or weaknesses can significantly
hinder the acceptance and utility of robots. Hence, we seek to enhance understanding of the reciprocal relationship between cybersecurity and trust, in which the strength of one directly influences
the other.
We also examine the concept of physical and data-related safety in robotic systems to ensure
these systems can handle, store, and process information without compromising user privacy or
system integrity. We stress that a well-rounded approach to safety that incorporates cybersecurity
aspects is crucial for the broader acceptance and integration of robotic systems into everyday life.
Throughout this article, we strive to create a comprehensive picture of the intersection between
safety, trust, and cybersecurity in the context of robotics. This holistic understanding is intended
to inform future design principles, inspire innovative solutions to existing challenges, and drive
the development of more secure, trustworthy, and user-friendly robotic systems.
Table 2 encapsulates the intricacies and broad scope of these challenges. This table furnishes a
structured and concise representation of the multitude of issues in this article, including those
arising from the intersection of human-robot trust, safety, and cybersecurity in robotics. This
tabular representation is not merely a listing of challenges but an integrated framework that
binds these diverse issues together. It provides a visual reference point for the interconnected
web of challenges that spans trust, safety, and cybersecurity. Each entry in the table represents a unique challenge that serves as a part of the larger puzzle that this article aims to
solve.
Further sections delve deeper into these challenges to meticulously explore their origins, implications, and potential solutions. We aim to dissect the synergies between them while illustrating
the intricately intertwined nature of trust,safety, and security in the field of robotics. The intention
is to expose the complex dynamics to prompt a more nuanced understanding and foster a holistic
approach to addressing these challenges. By offering this comprehensive insight into the interconnected landscape of trust and security challenges in robotics, we aspire to augment the existing
body of knowledge and catalyse a shift in how these challenges are approached. This expansion
can potentially inspire innovative strategies that pave the way for developing robotic systems that
are more secure, trustworthy, and ultimately more beneficial to society.
The contents of Table 2 overview the primary challenges affecting human-robot trust that encompass various aspects of HRI, such as communication, transparency, and familiarity. Each entry
in the table includes a brief description of the challenge and its significance and potential impact
on trust in robotic systems. The extensive literature on human-robot trust informs these challenges, including the experimental approach to human-technology interactions presented by [10],
[16–18], [27], [29], [34], [40], and [64].
Oksanen and colleagues focused on trust towards robots and AI in online environments by
emphasising the importance of understanding the factorsthatshape trust and the role of individual
differences in determining trust-related attitudes and behaviours. By considering these insights,
we seek to better contextualise the challenges presented in Table 2 and consider the role of human
factors in addressing these obstacles. In the following sections, we explore each challenge in depth,
guided by the research conducted by [64] and other prominentscholarsin the field of human-robot
trust.
2.6 Taxonomy of Trust-Relevant Failures
The authors of the study “Taxonomy of Trust-Relevant Failures and Mitigation Strategies” [65],
Tolmeijer and colleagues, formulated an in-depth taxonomy classifying different types of failures
in HRI and assessed their subsequent influence on trust. This meticulously devised taxonomy
serves two purposes: (1) it provides an organised structure for the extensive body of knowledge in
the field, and (2) it identifies existing research gaps. Thus, it facilitates fellow researchers’ endeavours to develop more trustworthy robotic systems. The taxonomy categorises failures into four
main types––design, system, expectation, and user––offering potential strategies to counter each
type.
To set the stage, Tolmeijer et al. [65] defined trust as “an individual’s willingness to depend on
a robot in the execution of its tasks”. Given that HRI involves two distinct entities––the robotic
system and the human interacting with it––Tolmeijer and colleagues based their taxonomy on an
initial key bifurcation: the source of the action resulting in a breach of trust, either (1) the system
or (2) the user. Subsequently, they classified the type of failure and the categorisation of the actions
leading to diverse types of failure by differentiating four distinct types of failures concerning their
impact on trust and the associated mitigation strategies: (1) design, (2) system, (3) expectation, and
(4) user.
2.6.1 Design Failures. As part of their research, Tolmeijer and colleagues characterised design
failures in the taxonomy as follows. Picture the development of a robotic system where every aspect (e.g., behaviour, appearance, and dialogue) has been designed to the best of one’s abilities. In
practical scenarios, the system operates precisely as intended, but it eventually becomes evident
that the design choices were not ideally suited for effective HRI. An example is adding a specific
function to the robot that is seldom used because the command is not as user-friendly as initially
thought, which impacts the trust users place in the system. Users misinterpret the system’s output
due to its design, have difficulty understanding the interaction, or are unaware of certain functionalities that they should know fall under the category of design failures. These failures are confined
to the system’s intended user base, as the system’s behaviour should, in hindsight, be different in
cases of design failures.
2.6.2 System Failures. Tolmeijer and colleagues defined a system failure in the taxonomy as a
situation where the robotic system does not perform as planned. For instance, during a navigation
task, the robot may inexplicably halt in the middle of a room or cease a scanning task due to a
Table 3. A Table of HRI Failure Types [65]
Failure Type Action By Meant to Act
This Way?
In Retrospect, Should the
Actor Behave This Way?
Description
Design System Yes No The system does what it was made to do, but, in retrospect, it
should not behave this way.
System System No No The system does not do what it was made to do.
Expectation System Yes Yes The system does what it was made to do but differs from user
expectations. In retrospect, the system should behave this way.
User User No If the design fails, yes. If the
expectation fails, no.
Users behave as they are not supposed to, which is only a
problem if it leads to other failures.
malfunctioning scanner. Thus, the system fails to execute its intended functions, possibly due to a
system crash. These failures can be classified into two categories: hardware and software failures.
2.6.3 Expectation Failures. Tolmeijer and colleagues identified expectation failures as instances
where the robotic system functions as intended but contradicts the user’s expectations. For instance, a user may anticipate a robot to turn while scanning a room. However, if the robot does
not need to execute the action, it can confuse the user despite the system performing correctly.
This omission failure occurs when the robot does not act as the user expects. Conversely, a commission failure is when the robot executes an action the user does not expect, such as moving in
the middle of an interaction to recharge its battery.
Expectation failures differ from design failures. With expectation failures, the system’s behaviour should remain the same in hindsight, whereas in the case of a design failure, it should
not. For instance, in the scenario where the robot does not turn, it is deemed an expectation failure. However, a corresponding design failure likely exists, given that the robot does not adequately
explain its actions to the user. Thus, in this example, the design failure triggers the expectation
failure.
2.6.4 User Failures. Tolmeijer and colleagues’ final category in the taxonomy was user failures,
defined as scenarios where the user interacts with the system inappropriately or unexpectedly,
intentionally (e.g., disrupting or sabotaging the robot) or unintentionally (e.g., standing in the
robot’s path and preventing it from moving). This type of failure can be triggered by a design
or expectation failure, which can impact trust and shape potential mitigation strategies. While an
expectation failure pertains to what the user anticipates the robot to do, a user failure is concerned
with what the users themselves do. Naturally, expectation failures can inadvertently result in user
failures. These identified failure types collectively form the basis of the taxonomy presented in
Table 3.
This taxonomy can provide pivotal insights into CPSs, where the digital and physical worlds
seamlessly integrate and interact. As these systems often involve complex interactions between
humans and automated systems––including robots––the failures identified by [65] can significantly shape the trust dynamics within CPSs. As such, the mitigation strategies proposed within
this taxonomy can serve as a useful guide for developing and operating trustworthy CPSs.
The taxonomy of trust-relevant failures in robotic systems provides a valuable framework for
understanding how various failures impact HRI. This taxonomy facilitates a structured approach
to assessing and mitigating factors that erode trust in robotic systems by categorising failures into
design, system, expectation, and user-induced failures. For example, design failures often stem
from choices in appearance, functionality, or interface that may not align with user needs, so they
inadvertently decrease usertrust. This unintended misalignment can undermine users’ willingness
to rely on the system, especially when the design does not accommodate expected functionality or
intuitive interaction. Similarly, expectation failures highlight the importance of meeting user anticipations since a deviation from expected behaviour—even if the system functions as intended—
can generate confusion and erode trust in scenarios where predictability and understanding are
crucial.
In examining system and user-induced failures, the taxonomy emphasises the importance of
operational reliability and appropriate user interactions within the HRI context. System failures,
whether due to hardware malfunctions or software crashes, are particularly concerning, as they
reflect a direct breakdown in the robot’s capabilities, which compromises users’ perceptions of
its reliability. Moreover, user-induced failures arising from unintentional or intentional misuse
underscore the need for educating users and designing robots that can account for various user
behaviours. These insights suggest that addressing trust-relevant failures requires a multifaceted
approach encompassing technical improvements, cybersecurity, user education, and adaptive design strategies. By systematically addressing these failure types, designers can create more robust
robotic systems that foster user trust through predictable, reliable, and intuitive interactions.
2.7 Advancements in Human-to-Robot Trust
CPS development hasled to significant advancementsin HRI and collaboration in recent years. One
critical aspect emerging in this context is the trust between humans and robots, which is pivotal
in ensuring smooth, efficient, and safe collaboration in various application domains, including
manufacturing [66, 67]. Thissection aimsto review the literature on the advancements and current
state of human-robot trust in CPSs.
Benini [68] highlighted the potential of micropower deep learning for cognitive CPSs, which
can lead to more reliable and efficient interactions between humans and robots. As these systems
become more intelligent and capable of handling complex tasks, the trust between humans and
robots is expected to grow. This concept was further emphasised by Krueger et al. [66], who examined the incorporation of cognitive robots into the manufacturing industry through vertical and
cyber-physical integration strategies. The authors argued that incorporating cognitive robots in
industrial processes enhances trust through improved adaptability and responsiveness to human
input.
Moreover, Pacaux-Lemoine et al. [67] explored the concept of human-based industrial CPSs
while stressing the importance of trust in human and robot collaboration. They argued that establishing trust is fundamental to improving the performance and ensuring the safety of these
systems. They further advocated for developing transparent, adaptable, and resilient systems to
ensure high trust between humans and robots in the working environment.
Rahman [69] presented cognitive cyber-physical systems (C-CPSs) for manufacturing collaboration between humans and robots. In this framework, the cognitive aspect is vital for enhancing
trust between human operators and robotic systems, as it ensures more natural and intuitive interactions. Moreover, Rahman and Ikeura [70, 71] suggested intelligent admittance control strategies
grounded in cognition and algorithms for admittance control based on fixed and variable weight
perception for the power-assisted handling of heavy objects. These schemes promote intuitive and
natural HRI, which fosters trust and improves overall system performance.
Advancements in C-CPSs have led to significant improvements in human-robot trust. Integrating cognitive robots into manufacturing and other industries has demonstrated their potential to
enhance trust through increased adaptability, responsiveness, and transparency. Nevertheless, further research into cognition-based control schemes and HRI methods is necessary to solidify trust
and optimise the performance of collaborative CPSs.
The upcoming section details the challenges in Table 2 to explore their implications, current
approaches, and potentialsolutions. Furthermore, we examine the interplay between human-robot
trust challenges and cybersecurity issuesto identify areas of overlap and opportunitiesforsynergy.
This analysis contributes to developing a more robust and secure framework for HRI that paves
the way for robotics’ safe and effective integration into our daily lives.
2.8 Challenges to Cyber-Physical System Safety
With the rapid advancement of technology, integrating CPSs has become increasingly prevalent
in various domains and revolutionised how humans interact with machines [72]. CPSs encompass
a wide range of interconnected systems that combine computational and physical elements to
enable seamless collaboration between humans and robots [73]. Among the emerging domains,
HRI holds great promise for transforming industries, healthcare, and daily life. However, as
the boundaries between humans and robots blur, ensuring safety in these interactions becomes
paramount [74].
The dynamic nature of CPS, coupled with the complexity of HRI, presents significant challenges
that must be addressed to ensure the well-being and trust of humans and robots [75]. The aspect of
safety is even more critical when considering the interaction between humans and industrial collaborative robots, which traditionally operate in restricted areas due to their inherent risks [72].
These challenges pertain to physical safety and encompass emotional and psychological safety,
with trust, as explored in previous sections, being a critical aspect of effective human-robot collaboration [75].
Thissection delvesinto the multifaceted challengesin human-robotsafety to explore the current
state of research and propose potential solutions to mitigate risks and foster safe and harmonious
collaborations. Studies have proposed different strategies for ensuring safety, such as calculating the minimum safe distance between humans and robots [76], controlling robots within a safe
set [77], and developing strategies for various levels of interaction [78]. Nevertheless, the evolving landscape of CPSs and HRI necessitates a continuous assessment and update of these safety
strategies [73].
Indeed, the safety spectrum in HRI encompasses physical and psychological dimensions. From
the standpoint of physical safety, several strategic frameworks have been proposed to minimise
potential hazards during human-robot collaboration. A vital aspect of these strategies is delineating safe working spaces for humans and robots. For instance, Safeea et al.’s (2017) work stands out
in this domain, as they developed a comprehensive model to calculate the minimum safe distance
between human operators and robotic systems during interaction [76]. This research provides a
fundamental base for designing protocols to ensure physical safety in various HRI contexts, from
industrial to healthcare environments.
Furthermore, controlling the operation of robots within designated safe sets is another critical
aspect of maintaining physical safety. Liu and Tomizuka (2014) meticulously explored this concept
and proposed advanced control strategies for robots operating within defined safety boundaries
[77]. Complementarily, Bdiwi et al. (2017) revealed a novel strategy to protect human safety during various phases of interaction, particularly in industrial environments [78]. Their pioneering
strategy emphasised the need for dynamic, adaptable safety measures that adjust to evolving interaction scenarios and minimise risk factors.
Trust between humans and robots becomes crucial on the psychological safety front. As a linchpin of successful HRI, trust is not just a mere psychological aspect; it greatly influences how humans perceive and respond to robots [75]. Salem and Dautenhahn (2015) conducted a thorough
assessment of trust and safety within HRI that elucidated the pragmatic complications and ethical quandaries fundamental to the swiftly evolving arena of robotics [75]. They underscored the
significance of fostering trust through reliable and predictable robot behaviours, transparency in
operations, and respect for user autonomy.
Table 4. Challenges in Human-Robot Interaction Safety
Challenge Description
Maintaining safe distances ... requires calculating the minimum safe distance between humans and robots to avoid
accidental collisions [76].
Control within a safe set ... implements control strategies for robots operating within designated safety boundaries
[77] and devising new strategies for safe interaction with industrial robots [78].
Managing unexpected interactions and accidents ... mitigate safety issues during unexpected interactions or accidents [74].
Building trust and psychological safety ... builds trust and addressing practical and ethical challenges in HRIs [75].
CPS integration ... ensures safety during the integration of computational and physical elements, requiring
new interaction strategies [72].
In the era of CPSs, ensuring safety in HRI has become more intricate due to the deep integration
of computational and physical elements. A notable contribution was from Garcia-Esteban et al.
(2021), who proposed a method of engagement designed to address safety challenges arising from
human collaboration with industrial collaborative robots within CPSs[72]. Their work exemplified
the complex challenges emerging from the fusion of physical and digital elements and underscored
the need for context-specific safety protocols in CPS environments.
In sum, despite the significantstridesin addressing safety issuesin HRI, it remains an active area
of research that necessitates constant updates to safety protocols and strategies. The continual
advancements in CPSs and the complexity of HRI dynamics call for the ongoing scrutiny and
refinement of safety mechanisms to cater to evolving industrial and societal needs [73].
The intersection between cybersecurity, trust, and safety is pivotal in HRI. Ensuring physical
and cyber safety becomes paramount as we increasingly rely on robots in various sectors, from
industry to healthcare. However, trust forms the crucial link that ties these elements together.
Trust is the foundation upon which users feel confident about security and safety measures, which
potentially influences how they perceive and interact with robots.
In the context of HRI safety, trust plays a multifaceted role. From a psychological safety standpoint, trust is a critical factor that can mitigate fears and apprehensions associated with robot
interaction. For instance, trust in a robot’s ability to maintain a safe distance during interaction, as
outlined in Table 4, is essential for ensuring user confidence and system reliability [76]. Similarly,
users must trust that robots can effectively operate within designated safe sets [77] and that safety
measures will adjust dynamically to various interaction levels [78].
Cybersecurity comes into play as a potential determinant of trust in HRI. Robots are essentially
CPSs, so they are vulnerable to cyber threats that can compromise their operation and safety.
Cyberattacks can manipulate robot controls, disrupt operations within safe sets, and even cause
physical harm. Therefore,stringent cybersecurity measures are essential to ensure safety and build
usertrust. Moreover, asrobots handle personal data, users must trust the robustness of data privacy
and security measures. A breach in cybersecurity can potentially lead to a loss of trust that may
take a long time to rebuild and can hinder effective HRI.
Therefore, trust in HRI is not only about robots’ physical performance and cyber resilience. A
comprehensive approach to safety in HRI needs to address physical safety measures and cybersecurity protocols. Building and maintaining trust requires demonstrating the robot’s reliability in
maintaining safety standards and resilience against cyber threats.
In conclusion, we propose that cybersecurity, trust, and safety in HRI are intertwined. Cybersecurity measures protect users and robots by enhancing safety. At the same time, effective safety
measures and cybersecurity protocols foster trust in HRI, which, in turn, facilitates effective and
efficient interactions. Addressing the challenges mentioned in the table above, from maintaining
safe distances to managing unexpected interactions, depends on robots’ physical capabilities, robust cybersecurity measures, and user trust in these systems.
2.9 Taxonomy of Safety Failures
Safety remains a critical HRI consideration. Robots are capable of powerful movements and potentially pose hazards to humans around them. In this regard, a pressing necessity arises to identify
potential sources of harm, determine who among those in the robot’s vicinity may be at the most
significant risk, and assess the injuries the robot may inflict [74].
Vasic and Billard [74] initiated a review of safety issues in industrial settings. In these scenarios,
robots often manipulate dangeroustools and perform tasks with exceptionalspeed and force. Strict
safety protocols and guardrails usually surround these robots, which isolates them within specific
work cells to prevent accidents. However, with the gradual relaxation of these rules, safety issues
come to the fore. Thus, formulating context-specific safety guidelines for each robot becomes an
urgent priority for the scientific and industrial communities [74].
Vasic and Billard [74] also discussed autonomous mobile robots, which are increasing in number
and operating in crowded, human-inhabited environments. Despite elaborate sensor networks and
sophisticated control strategies, the rise in accidents involving mobile robots potentially threatens
human safety. This concern is particularly salient with autonomous vehicles, which are believed
to increase road and pedestrian safety soon. However, these vehicles introduce a new threat profile, which emphasises the need for clear guidelines and robust safety measures to ensure their
integration improves road safety rather than exacerbating the risks [74].
Vasic and Billard [74] investigated safety issues related to assistive robots, which have high potential but pose distinct challenges. Asrobots grow in complexity, especially humanoid robots with
multiple degrees of freedom, the risk of injuries increases due to unexpected movements and the
possibility of trapping a person between two joints. The unpredictability of a robot’s movements
adds another layer of complexity to ensuring safety. Addressing these challenges requires the development of new sensing technologies,robust and swiftsensorfusion algorithmsforthe real-time
tracking of multiple moving targets, effective predictive systems for human motion detection, and
fast-responsive controllers capable of re-planning trajectories in cluttered environments on the
fly [74]. In their 2013 comprehensive study, Vasic and Billard categorised the causes of accidents
in robot-related mishaps: mechanical and control system deficiencies, human-induced errors, and
adverse environmental conditions[74]. The first category, mechanical and controlsystem deficiencies, refers to faults inherent in the robot’s construction or control mechanisms, including hardware malfunctions (e.g., loose connections, electronic failures, and design oversights) that compromise the structural integrity of the robot. Similarly, the controller, which governs the robot’s
behaviour, can harbour software glitches, algorithmic inaccuracies, and programming anomalies,
which leads to aberrant robot operation. Such anomalies can cause the robot to exhibit unintended
behaviours, such as the failure to halt when needed or uncontrolled acceleration. Accidents arising
from these deficiencies present a formidable challenge, as they are typically unpredictable, which
makes them insusceptible to pre-emption by even the most observant human operator. Humaninduced errors, the second category, are comparatively more manageable. These incidents arise
from myriad human factors (e.g., a lack of focus, operator fatigue, a disregard for established safety
protocols, inadequate training regimens, and the employment of erroneous procedures during robot initialisation). Human errors do not solely indicate operator negligence but often stem from
innate human performance limitations. A momentary lapse in concentration or the misinterpretation of complex directives can result in such errors.
The third category concerns adverse environmental conditions. This category encapsulates conditions that can detrimentally impact the robot’s performance and, consequently, the safety of its
operation. Factors contributing to this category can range from extremes in temperature to impaired sensing capabilities due to suboptimal weather or lighting conditions and other external
circumstances leading to incorrect robot responses.
Figure 2 categorises safety failures into three primary types: (1) mechanical and control system
deficiencies, (2) human-induced errors, and (3) adverse environmental conditions. Each category
is further divided into subcategories that detail specific failures (e.g., hardware malfunctions, software errors, human operational mistakes, and environmental impacts like lighting and temperature extremes). The hierarchical structure is designed to illustrate the interdependencies between
these factors, which highlights how a single failure type can cascade into other categories and
ultimately affect the safety and reliability of robotic systems [74]. Ensuring safety in HRIs requires
understanding this triad of potential accident causes, as depicted in Figure 2. Addressing these
categories can significantly enhance the development of safety protocols and system designs to
foster safer and more effective human-robot collaborations [74].
As robots increasingly integrate into numerous facets of human existence, the potential risks
they pose emerge as a paramount issue. The assurance of safety in HRI encompasses implementing physical safety precautions and creating sophisticated systems capable of anticipating and
promptly reacting to an extensive array of situations. The challenge lies in balancing the utility
of robots while minimising their potential threats, which necessitates continuous research and
innovation [74].
2.10 Conclusion: Foundations for Secure Robotics
The exploration ofrobotics and CPSs underscoresthe intricate interplay between physical and digital realms, especially within applications where HRI is prevalent. This overview highlights the essential need for frameworksthat address operational functionality and the multifaceted challenges
that arise from trust,safety, and cybersecurity perspectives. Asroboticstechnology progresses and
these systems become more integral to critical applications, vulnerabilities within legacy systems
and modern cybersecurity risks increasingly demand holistic, multidisciplinary solutions.
In recognising the limitations of isolated approaches to CPS and robotics, the field moves towards a more integrated concept of “secure robotics”. This paradigm seeks to synthesise knowledge across cybersecurity,safety engineering, and ethicalstandardsto foster trust and resilience in
these systems. The following section introduces the secure robotics framework, which establishes
a structured approach to tackle these crossover challenges. Through this model, we aim to advance
the theoretical and practical groundwork necessary for secure, trustworthy, and adaptable robotic
systems that can thrive in diverse, real-world environments.
3 Secure Robotics
3.1 Contextualising the Emergence of Secure Robotics
The rapid advancement and integration of robotics across sectors, including healthcare, transportation, and personal assistance, underscore the growing need for robust cybersecurity practices to ensure these systems’ safety, reliability, and trustworthiness. According to the National
Robotics Strategy, robotics and automation technologies designed for use in Australia must be
secure by design to mitigate cyber risks and uphold public trust [49]. The emerging field of secure robotics emphasises the necessity of incorporating cybersecurity measures from the design
phase through the deployment and operational stages. This rounded approach aims to safeguard
against malicious threats and ensure system resilience within critical environments. The National
Robotics Strategy highlights the urgent need for regulatory frameworks to address unique vulnerabilities within robotic systems, including secure data management and privacy protections
for users and operators. Implementing these measures supports a foundational approach to security that allows robotic systems to operate safely in complex human-centric settings and reduces
the risk of breaches or malfunctions [49]. The strategy’s commitment to “safe, secure, lawful, and
ethical” robotic design reflects a recognition of the interconnectedness of technological progress
and cybersecurity. By integrating cybersecurity practices as a core development element, secure
robotics ensures the adoption of trustworthy, resilient technologies that contribute positively to
society without compromising safety or privacy. Secure-by-design principles will be essential as
the field advances to ensure these systems’ continued resilience and reliability [49]. This call for
secure robotics emphasises the importance of establishing trust within these systems and fostering an ecosystem where robotic and autonomous systems are innovative yet resilient, reliable, and
secure against external and internal risks.
3.2 Defining Secure Robotics
Secure robotics has emerged as a multidisciplinary field integrating principles from cybersecurity,
HRI, and safety engineering, as illustrated in Figure 3. This figure presents a framework that consolidates the key domains necessary for developing secure and trustworthy robotic systems and
emphasises how these diverse disciplines intersect to address complex challenges related to system integrity, operational safety, and user trust. By visualising these interdependencies, the figure
underscores the necessity of an integrated approach to managing security risks in multifaceted
robotic environments. The figure highlights the need for a unified approach addressing cybersecurity, safety, trust, and ethical design challenges by mapping out these disciplinary intersections.
This field endeavours to create robotic systems that are efficient and effective for their intended
tasks while fortifying against cyber threats, establishing trust in human interactions, and ensuring
inherent safety across diverse operational settings. Its scope transcends technical proficiency by
delving into ethical considerations, user privacy, and the psychological impacts of robotic integration, which places secure robotics at the vanguard of addressing contemporary technological
challenges.
3.3 Rationale for a Multidisciplinary Framework in Secure Robotics
Figure 3 presents a classification scheme that unifies critical domains fundamental to secure robotics (e.g., cybersecurity, HRI, safety engineering, ethical considerations, user privacy, psychological
impacts, and technical proficiency). These domains are not isolated silos but interconnected fields
that collectively shape the security, safety, and reliability of modern robotic systems. A multidisciplinary approach is essential because each domain introduces distinct yet complementary
factors that, when integrated, create a cohesive and resilient security framework. For instance,
Fig. 3. A Multidisciplinary Approach to Secure Robotics.
This figure presents a comprehensive framework illustrating the integration of critical disciplines (e.g., cybersecurity, HRI, safety engineering, and ethical considerations) essential for developing secure and trustworthy robotic
systems. Each branch represents a distinct domain of expertise that contributes uniquely to the overall security,
functionality, and societal acceptance of robotic technologies. The interconnected nature of these components
highlights how domains such as cybersecurity and HRI converge to address trust and data integrity while safety
engineering and ethical considerations intersect to ensure compliance with safety standards and promote responsible use. By depicting these overlaps, the framework underscores the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach
to mitigating security risks, enhancing user experience, and ensuring that robotic systems operate safely and
ethically across diverse contexts.
cybersecurity strategies must be harmonised with human-centric design principles from HRI to
ensure robust protection mechanisms do not compromise usability, user trust, or system transparency. Similarly, safety engineering must work in tandem with technical proficiency and ethical
standards to guarantee the safe operation of autonomous systems without breaching moral and
societal expectations.
The necessity for merging these diverse fields in Figure 3 stems from the intricate security challenges inherent to robotics, which span multiple disciplines, each with its own methodologies and
standards. While cybersecurity frameworks (e.g., NIST SP 800-53) provide foundational guidelines
for protecting data integrity and availability, they lack the operational safeguards found in safety
engineering standards (e.g., ISO 10218-1), which focus on physical safety in industrial robotics. By
synthesising cybersecurity, safety engineering, and technical proficiency within a unified framework, the classification equipsrobotic systemsto counter external cyberthreats and internalsafety
risks by addressing vulnerabilities arising from overlapping concerns. Furthermore, incorporating
HRI and ethical considerations into this structure ensures that the approach is not purely technical but also aligns with broader societal values to support safer and more ethical autonomous
decision-making.
The inclusion of user privacy and psychological impacts elevates the classification’s applicability by bridging the gap between technical rigour and human experience. Privacy frameworks
(e.g., ISO/IEC 27001) are essential for safeguarding personal data, particularly in sensitive environments such as healthcare and domestic applications, where breaches can have severe consequences. Meanwhile, understanding the psychological impacts of robotic systems is crucial for
fostering trust and ensuring long-term adoption. Without attention to these human-centric aspects, even the most technically advanced systems may fail to achieve widespread acceptance.
Thus, integrating these domains creates a holistic framework to address immediate security and
safety needs and adapt to the evolving landscape of HRI. This approach ensures that the classification model in Figure 3 serves as a robust foundation for developing secure, reliable, and ethically
sound robotic systems capable of operating in complex, real-world environments.
3.4 Methodology for Developing the Classification Framework
The development of the secure robotics classification framework was underpinned by a rigorous and structured methodology designed to synthesise and integrate the diverse domains intersecting within secure robotics. Drawing on best practices from systematic literature review
(SLR) methodologies, this process sought to ensure depth and comprehensiveness in capturing
the complexities inherent in cybersecurity, HRI, and safety engineering. Following the foundational principles established by Bereton et al. [79], the methodology adhered to the rigour necessary for replicable and transparent research, a hallmark of robust SLR processes. Furthermore,
the framework’s development was informed by the practical guidance outlined in Carrera-Rivera
et al. [80], which provided a detailed roadmap for executing SLRs within the context of multidisciplinary computer science research. This dual reliance on the established literature ensured
that the methodology was thorough and adaptable to the evolving challenges at the intersection
of CPSs. By adhering to these structured SLR approaches, the framework’s development followed
six distinct stages, each designed to integrate domain-specific insights into a cohesive classification model reflecting the dynamic and multifaceted nature of secure robotics. The emphasis on
methodological rigour sought to ensure that the resulting framework provided a solid foundation for addressing the crossover challenges presented by the convergence of cybersecurity, trust,
safety, and ethical considerations in modern robotic systems.
Step 1 – Identification of Core Research Domains: The initial step involved defining research
questions and establishing the scope of the review using a modified population, intervention,
comparison, outcome, and context (PICOC) framework, a standard for conducting SLRs in
engineering and technical domains [79, 80]. The core research domains identified included cybersecurity, human-robot trust, safety standards, ethical considerations, data privacy, and technical
proficiency. This alignment ensured that the classification framework addressed the multidisciplinary nature of secure robotics.
Step 2 – Systematic Literature Search and Selection: A pragmatic search strategy was employed using domain-specific keywords across digital libraries (e.g., IEEE Xplore and ACM Digital Library).
The search captured a comprehensive dataset of studies relevant to the six identified domains.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined to ensure that only peer-reviewed articles, industry standards, and high-impact research papers were prioritised. This search strategy adhered to
PRISMA guidelines by following a structured approach outlined in the literature for systematic
reviews in CPSs and robotics [79].
Step 3 – Data Extraction and Quality Assessment: Each study was assessed for relevance and
quality using a structured data extraction form that captured key elements such as security mechanisms, threat models, risk mitigation strategies, and implementation contexts. Quality was evaluated using a tailored checklist adapted from Carrera-Rivera et al. [80] to assess research rigour,
validity, and applicability to secure robotics. Studies that did not meet the quality criteria were
excluded to maintain the methodological robustness of the review.
Step 4 – Thematic Analysis and Categorisation: Thematic analysis was conducted to identify
cross-domain interactions and recurring themes (e.g., trust, safety, and ethical conflicts), which
were mapped to establish core categories. The process followed best practices for thematic synthesis in SLRs to ensure that all relevant aspects of secure robotics were represented. This stage
highlighted key overlapping themes (e.g., the convergence of safety engineering and cybersecurity) as seen in the broader literature on CPS security.
Step 5 – Framework Synthesis and Validation: The synthesised themes were used to develop the
secure robotics classification framework, which incorporated insights from HRI, cybersecurity,
and the safety engineering literature. The framework was refined through an iterative process,
including expert reviews and cross-validation with existing standards like NIST SP 800-53 and
ISO/IEC 27001. The validation process ensured that the framework addressed practical concerns
and industry requirements.
Step 6 – Reporting and Dissemination: The final stage involved documenting the findings in a
structured format by adhering to the guidelines for systematic review reporting outlined by Brereton et al. [79]. The framework is visualised in Figure 3 above to provide a structured approach
to categorising security concerns. It is elaborated further in Section 3.5.
3.5 Developing a Multidisciplinary Classification Schema for Secure Robotics
The classification schema presented in Figure 3 builds on this multidisciplinary foundation by providing a structured methodology to categorise the dimensions of secure robotics and offer clear
classification principles and reference basesfor each domain. Thisscheme is grounded in an extensive literature review spanning the critical areas of the proposed secure robotics paradigm. Each
classification captures specific requirements for enhancing robotic systems’ security, safety, and
trustworthiness to ensure alignment with established standards and empirical findings. By incorporating these domains, the classification model addresses the unique challenges posed by each
field and integrates them into a cohesive framework that can be applied across various robotic
applications.
The following subsections provide explanations of each category, which emphasise their significance and the rationale for their inclusion within the overarching framework. This categorisation
reinforcesthe multidisciplinary approach established by the rationale and demonstratesits efficacy
in integrating the diverse requirements of secure robotics. The intersecting domains are colourcoded to correspond with the relevant branches of the secure robotics diagram in Figure 3, ensure
visual coherence, and strengthen the relationship between the classification model and the broader
framework. This approach seeks to offer visual consistency and highlight the intricate interplay
between cybersecurity, human-robot interaction, safety, and ethical considerations to effectively
bridge these critical domains within the framework.
• Cybersecurity: The cybersecurity classifications are structured using well-established standards (e.g., NIST SP 800-53 [81] and ISO/IEC 62443 [82]), which outline the fundamental
controls required for securing industrial and service robotics. These standards provide a
detailed breakdown of key cybersecurity elements, including access control, data integrity,
incident response, and system resilience, to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential
cyber threats. To further enhance the model’s applicability to robotic systems, additional
insights have been incorporated from the MITRE ATT&CK for Industrial Control Systems
(ICS) [83] and NIST SP 800-82 [84] frameworks, which specifically address the unique security challenges in CPSs. The cybersecurity category encompasses a wide range of measures
to protect robotic systems from threats and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and operations. This classification includes network security,secure communications, and software hardening techniques designed to prevent unauthorised access and
data breaches. Recent frameworks (e.g., the task-oriented surveillance system for virtual
emotion informatics [85]) are highly effective in complex environments involving heterogeneous robotic components and sensor networks. These frameworks focus on integrating
secure data transmission protocols and intrusion detection systems for mobile robots and
UAVs in dynamic, multi-layered operational settings. By incorporating these advanced approaches, the cybersecurity classification ensures that secure robotic systems can operate
reliably in high-risk environments to safeguard critical information and maintain robust
system integrity.
• HRI: The HRI classification focuses on the dynamics between humans and robots, particularly in collaborative and service contexts. Research by Hancock et al. (2011) [34] and Lee
and See (2004) [16] provided the basis for defining subcomponents (e.g., Transparency, Intention Communication, and Consistency), which are essential for establishing user trust
and enhancing interaction quality. These elements reflect how robotic systems can effectively communicate their internal states and future actions to human operators by promoting predictable and safe interactions.
• Safety Engineering: Safety classifications are structured using the ISO 10218-1: Industrial
Robot Safety [86] and ISO 13849-1: Safety of Machinery [87] standards. These guidelines
specify requirements for functional safety, risk assessment, and hazard mitigation that focus on ensuring that robotic systems can operate without posing undue risk to humans or
the environment. Karwowski’s human factors and ergonomics [88] were also referenced
to incorporate considerations for human-robot coexistence, operational safety, and physical ergonomics, particularly in collaborative and high-risk environments. These considerations include the ability to manage safety-critical functions (e.g., collision avoidance,
emergency stop protocols, and risk assessment) in dynamic settings. An example of a recent approach is a harmonised framework for all-ways security surveillance and disaster
prevention in eco-friendly smart cities, which integrates heterogeneous devices to enhance
real-time monitoring and response capabilities[89]. Thisframework is particularly relevant
for managing safety in large-scale deployments, where multiple robotic systems operate in
complex urban environments. By leveraging a combination of Internet of Things (IoT)
sensors and autonomous robotic units, the framework provides robust situational awareness and disaster mitigation strategiesto demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating safety
engineering principles in secure robotic systems.
• Ethical Considerations: Ethical classifications were developed using the IEEE Ethically
Aligned Design (EAD) [90] and the Asilomar AI Principles [91]. These guidelines emphasise respect for user autonomy, fairness, and accountability, which are critical for ensuring
that robotic systems operate in a socially responsible manner. Key ethical components(e.g.,
fairness, transparency, and non-discrimination) were incorporated to capture the broader
societal impact of deploying robotic systems across diverse contexts to ensure alignment
with established ethical principles.
User Privacy: User privacy is a fundamental consideration, particularly in systems that
collect, process, and store sensitive user data. Privacy classifications were derived from
the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [92] and the European Commission’s
Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI [93]. These sources provided the basis for defining
privacy subcomponents such as data minimisation, consent mechanisms, and secure data
storage to ensure the classification scheme aligned with global data protection standards
and user rights.
• Psychological Impacts: Psychological impacts are crucial in determining user acceptance,
trust, and successful integration of robotic systems into daily life. Understanding human
responses involves examining cognitive and emotional reactions to robotic behaviour
since factors such as predictability, transparency, and perceived control are pivotal in
fostering trust and psychological safety [94]. Akalin et al. highlighted that perceived
safety is significantly influenced by the robot’s motion, appearance, and behaviour, where
a lack of transparency or abrupt movements can induce anxiety or stress in users [95].
Integrating robotic systems into daily life requires addressing safety-critical environments
and everyday scenarios to ensure that robots are reliable and perceived as emotionally
supportive and non-threatening [96]. This emphasis on psychological safety is crucial
for secure robotics, where user comfort and confidence are foundational for successful
deployment in healthcare, public spaces, and high-stress operations. By categorising
psychological impacts into subcomponents (e.g., emotional security, comfort, perceived reliability, and predictability), secure robotic systems can be designed to proactively address
human concerns and enhance user engagement and operational trustworthiness [94–96].
• Technical Proficiency: The classification of technical proficiency in secure robotics extends
beyond basic operational capabilities by emphasising advanced robotic skills and research
proficiency. This approach is grounded in the foundational frameworks of the Robot Operating System (ROS1 & 2), which establish a structured methodology for developing, testing,
and deploying complex robotic applications [97]. ROS serves as a cornerstone for integrating modular design principles and facilitating communication across heterogeneous
robotic systems, which enables the efficient management of large-scale robotics projects.
Its flexibility supports proficiency in low-level control and high-level application deployment, so it is a critical tool for robotics researchers and engineers. The research proficiency
component is further enhanced by using ROS in experimental validation and simulation,
as it provides an ecosystem that supports rapid prototyping and iterative development.
Researchers can validate theoretical models in controlled environments before deploying
them in real-world scenarios by leveraging tools such as Gazebo for realistic simulations
and RViz for visualising complex robot states. This proficiency in using ROS for research
and deployment reflects an advanced understanding of robotic system integration and optimisation in alignment with contemporary trends in robotics research [97]. Thus, technical proficiency in secure robotics encompasses the ability to execute and coordinate complex actions while requiring mastery of research methodologies and deployment strategies
to ensure that systems are robust, scalable, and aligned with the evolving landscape of
secure CPSs.
3.6 Managing Crossover Challenges Using Multidisciplinary Strategies
The identification of key crossover challenges, as illustrated in Table 5, highlights the complex
and multifaceted nature of secure robotics systems, which arise due to the intersection of multiple domains such as cybersecurity, HRI, safety engineering, and ethical considerations. Figure 3
Table 5. Crossover Challenges in Secure Robotics
Crossover Challenge Intersecting Domains Description and Impact
Effective communication and
insecure networking
Cybersecurity, HRI Misconfigurations in robotic communication protocols can result in data leakage or manipulation
that compromises trust and decision-making, which is especially critical in systems using
heterogeneous robotic components (e.g., autonomous vehicles).
Anthropomorphic design and
psychological safety
Safety engineering, HRI Designing humanoid robots for eldercare requires physical and psychological safety measures to
ensure vulnerable users feel secure and supported. Poor design can lead to emotional distress or
system rejection.
Privacy violations in shared
workspaces
User privacy, Safety
engineering
In shared environments like factories or public spaces, safety mechanisms may conflict with
privacy protections (e.g., video monitoring for safety exposes sensitive information). Hence,
privacy-by-design frameworks are needed to incorporate safety principles.
Overtrust and insufficient
authentication
HRI, Cybersecurity Users may overestimate a robot’s capabilities, which leads to overtrust. Overtrust, combined with
weak authentication mechanisms, can result in exploitation by malicious actors. Hence,
strengthening user education and authentication is necessary to address this challenge.
Control within a safe set and
lack of self-healing processing
Safety engineering,
Technical proficiency
Ensuring that robotic systems maintain control within safe parameters is crucial, particularly in
safety-critical environments. However, without self-healing algorithms, the system remains
vulnerable to cascading failures if it encounters unexpected inputs or disruptions.
Ethical decision-making in
autonomous operations
Ethical considerations,
Technical proficiency
When robots make autonomous decisions, technical solutions must be aligned with ethical
guidelines. For example, an autonomous vehicle deciding between two harmful outcomes must
be equipped with ethical frameworks to guide its choices beyond just technical algorithms.
System vulnerabilities in
safety-critical applications
Safety engineering,
Cybersecurity
Cyber threats can target safety mechanisms in robotics (e.g., emergency stop protocols).
Ensuring these mechanisms are resilient to hacking and misconfigurations is critical for
maintaining safe operations.
User perceptions of unreliable
behaviour
HRI, Psychological
impacts
Unpredictable robotic behaviour can lead to user discomfort and mistrust, particularly in
human-robot collaboration settings. Addressing these requires consistent behaviour patterns and
transparent communication to enhance user comfort and confidence.
Balancing usability and
security
Technical proficiency,
Cybersecurity
Security measures often reduce usability, which leads to user frustration or unsafe workarounds.
This challenge requires adaptive security techniques that protect the system without hindering
operational efficiency.
Trade-offs between safety and
ethical constraints
Safety engineering,
Ethical considerations
Safety measures must sometimes be balanced against ethical principles (e.g., in situations where
ensuring physical safety conflicts with preserving user autonomy). Hence, ethical safety
boundaries are required to guide system behaviour.
Operational conflicts in
multi-robot systems
Technical proficiency,
Safety engineering
Coordination failures between multiple autonomous robots can lead to navigation conflicts or
resource contention that cause unexpected behaviours and operational breakdowns. Effective
conflict resolution algorithms and dynamic task allocation are necessary to prevent such issues.
Inadequate response in
high-stress environments
HRI,
Psychological impacts,
Cybersecurity
In high-stress scenarios (e.g., search-and-rescue operations), a robot’s failure to adapt quickly to
environmental changes can cause psychological stress for users and responders. Implementing
adaptive algorithms and transparent status updates is essential to mitigate this risk.
Transparency and ethical
concerns in data use
Ethical considerations,
User privacy
Using personal data in robotic systems raises transparency and consent issues. Systems must
ensure that data are used in accordance with user expectations and ethical guidelines,
particularly in surveillance or healthcare applications.
The table above synthesises the core challenges arising at the intersection of multiple domains, including cybersecurity, HRI,
safety engineering, ethical considerations, user privacy, psychological impacts, and technical proficiency. Each challenge listed
in the table emerges from the complex interplay between these domains, where overlapping concerns create new vulnerabilities or operational difficulties that cannot be addressed through a single-disciplinary approach. The challenges identified are
derived from an extensive literature review and individual domain-specific tables presented earlier in the manuscript. Table 5
highlights the need for a multidisciplinary strategy to effectively resolve these challenges by categorising them according to
their intersecting domains, which are colour-coded to match the relevant branches of the secure robotics diagram presented in
Figure 3. Hence, the table offers visual consistency that reinforces the relationship between the classification and the overall
framework. It also serves as the foundational basis for the subsequent development of the Composite Security Measurement
Model introduced in the following sections by offering a structured view of where critical security and safety concerns converge
in secure robotic systems.
serves as a visual representation of these interactions by showcasing how each domain influences
and interconnects with the others. The structured approach used in Figure 3 depicts how these
overlapping concerns can either intensify vulnerabilities or complicate the implementation of integrated security and safety measures. Each domain represented in Figure 3 contributes distinct
yet interrelated challenges that impact the overall security posture of robotic systems. For example, the domain of cybersecurity forms the foundational layer to ensure the integrity of data and
communications. However, when considered in conjunction with HRI, as shown in Figure 3, trustrelated issues such as transparency in system operations and secure data sharing become critical
components that must be managed concurrently. This convergence of cybersecurity and HRI is
a focal point in Table 5, which categorises challenges like “Effective Communication & Insecure
Networking” to illustrate how communication vulnerabilities can undermine user trust and compromise system security. Figure 3 further contextualises these interactions by integrating ethical
considerations and safety engineering, which demonstrates how the alignment of these domains
is necessary to address high-risk scenarios in autonomous and collaborative robotic applications.
For instance, the crossover challenge of “Anthropomorphic Design & Psychological Safety” is positioned at the intersection of HRI and safety engineering in Figure 3, which signifies that physical safety measures alone are insufficient in contexts such as eldercare robotics. Instead, they
require a comprehensive strategy that combines ergonomic design principles, ethical behaviour
modelling, and robust safety protocols, as detailed in Table 5. By mapping these interactions in
Figure 3, the framework provides a useful view of how these cross-domain challenges manifest
in real-world robotic deployments. The placement of ethical considerations at the intersection of
trust, safety, and cybersecurity further highlights the need for a multidisciplinary approach that
balances security measures with human-centric values to ensure that robotic systems are safe and
secure in alignment with societal expectations of ethical behaviour. This integration underscores
the importance of designing security models that do not merely focus on technical solutions but
also incorporate ethical and psychological dimensions, as indicated by the synthesis of themes in
Table 5.
The structured mapping in Figure 3 guides the development of the Composite Security Measurement Model to enable researchers to identify key leverage points where multidisciplinary
strategies can be applied to mitigate these crossover challenges. This visual representation informs the development of targeted solutions by clarifying the interdependencies between cybersecurity, safety, and trust, which ultimately leads to a more resilient and adaptive security posture
for robotic systems.
3.7 Towards a Composite Security Measurement Model for Cyber-Physical Systems
A more structured and quantifiable approach is required to navigate the complexities of secure robotics based on the key crossover challenges identified. The diversity of issues highlighted, ranging from trust and ethical considerations to technical vulnerabilities, necessitates introducing the
Composite Security Measurement Model—a tool imperative for defining the scientific locus of secure robotics within the broader multidisciplinary landscape. Table 5 categorises and describes
these challenges qualitatively, which makes it difficult to objectively evaluate the effectiveness of
specific strategiesfor mitigating them. Therefore, this modelserves as a theoretical construct and a
pragmatic framework for assessing, comparing, and optimising various dimensions of robotic systems across multiple domains to quantify the interplay and impact of cybersecurity, HRI, safety,
and ethical considerations.
The introduction of the Composite Security Measurement Model is crucial because it translates
qualitative challengesinto empirical, measurable constructsthat offer a systematic method to evaluate how well robotic systems align with established security and safety standards. By utilising
metrics that span multiple domains (e.g., data integrity, user trust, operational safety, and ethical
compliance), the model enables researchers and practitioners to adopt a more scientific approach
when analysing the resilience and robustness of robotics in complex, real-world environments.
For instance, cybersecurity can be measured through standard metrics like incident response
time and breach impact, while human-robot trust may be quantified using trust scales validated
in HRI research. Similarly, safety engineering parameters can be assessed through the frequency
of near-miss incidents or compliance with ISO 10218-1 safety standards. This multidimensional
evaluation provides a comprehensive understanding of system performance, which makes it
possible to identify domain-specific weaknesses and strengths to guide targeted improvements.
The composite measurement model ultimately bridges the gap between abstract challenges and
concrete, actionable research pathways. It enables a shift from conceptual discussions to empirical,
data-driven inquiries crucial for advancing secure robotics as a scientific discipline. By incorporating principles from established modelling frameworks [98–101], the model creates a foundation
for standardised assessment that facilitates comparison across robotic systems and operational
contexts. This approach is essential for validating new methodologies to ensure that the proposed
solutions are theoretically sound and practically effective in addressing the crossover challenges
identified earlier. Hence, the model lays the groundwork for a rigorous scientific methodology that
enhances secure robotics’ theoretical and applied dimensions.
4 Composite Security Measurement Model for Evaluating Cyber-physical Systems
4.1 Conceptualising the Model
The model for evaluating secure robotics is designed to address the multifaceted nature of robotic
systems by incorporating key components crucial for their safe and effective operation. The selected components––cybersecurity (C), trust (T), safety (S), ethical considerations (E), and human
factors (H)––are fundamental to the holistic assessment of robotic systems. Cybersecurity is critical to ensuring the robotic system’s resilience against cyber threats, data integrity, and prevention
of unauthorised access, which is pivotal in a landscape increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks
[102]. Trust is another essential aspect that reflects the reliability and predictability of the robotic
system from the user’s perspective [103, 104]. It encompasses transparency in operations and the
system’s ability to communicate intentions that influence user acceptance and integration into
various domains. Safety is paramount, especially considering the physical interaction between
robots and humans, and includes compliance with safety standards and effectiveness in operating
without causing harm [105, 106]. Ethical considerations, comprising respect for user privacy, nondiscrimination, and fairness, have been increasingly recognised as vital in the design and deployment of robotic systems [103, 107]. Lastly, human factors focusing on the ergonomic and psychological impact on users are fundamental to ensuring user-friendly and accessible robotic technologies. The weighted sum model in Equation (1) provides a composite measure of robotic systems’
overall performance and security that considers these diverse yet interrelated components. Each
component’s weight reflects its relative importance, which allows flexibility and adaptability in
different application contexts. This metric aids in identifying areas for enhancement and guiding
the development of secure, trustworthy, and ethically aligned robotic systems.
The burgeoning field of secure robotics necessitates a quantifiable approach to evaluate the
interplay between cybersecurity, trust, safety, ethical considerations, and human factors. To this
end, we propose a weighted sum model that provides a composite measure of robotic systems’
overall performance and security, as shown in Equation (1) below:
R = wc · C + wT · T + ws · S + wE · E + wH · H (1)
where model R represents the overall secure robotics measure and the components C, T, S, E, and H
symbolise cybersecurity, trust,safety, ethical considerations, and human factors, respectively, each
quantified on a scale from 0 to 100. The weights wC, wT, wS, wE, and wH correspond to the relative
importance of each component in a specific context of robotic application. R serves as a metric
that encapsulates the multifaceted nature of secure robotics. This model provides a structured
and nuanced approach to evaluating robotic systems by quantifying and weighting the diverse
elements of secure robotics. It aids in identifying areas of strength and potential improvement to
guide researchers and practitioners in developing secure, trustworthy, and human-aligned robotic
systems.

6 The Significance and Application of R In Secure Robotics
6.1 Utility and Application of R
The overall secure robotics measure R emerges as a fundamental metric in the field due to integrating diverse yet crucial aspects such as cybersecurity, trust, safety, ethical considerations, and
human factors into a singular, quantifiable framework. The utility of R lies in its ability to synthesise these dimensions into a comprehensive score that facilitates multidimensional evaluations
of robotic systems. This approach mirrors the multi-attribute utility theory discussed by Keeney
and Raiffa [144], which underscores the importance of aggregating various attributes for effective
decision-making. R can serve as a benchmarking tool, akin to methods seen in assessing complex
systems in engineering and technology [145]. It can be used to compare different robotic systems
or monitor the improvement of a single system over time to provide a clear metric for advancements and areas requiring attention.
6.2 Value in Secure Robotics
The value of R in secure robotics is multifaceted. Primarily, it enables a holistic assessment that extends beyond technical capabilities to include user-centric and ethical dimensions aligned with the
human-centred design approach in technology development while emphasising the importance of
user experience and ethical considerations [136]. Additionally, R fosters a culture of continuous
improvement in secure robotics. Quantitating performance across multiple domains provides clear
targets for development, similar to the role of metrics in guiding academic research [146].

ethical considerations are integral to technological advancement. This approach is vital in secure
robotics, where systems deployment directly impacts societal norms and individual well-being.
Moreover, R serves as a vital communication tool for conveying the multifaceted nature of secure
robotics to diverse stakeholders, including policymakers and the public. Integrating different dimensions into a unified measure is seen in other fields (e.g., environmental impact assessments)
[147]. R represents a significant stride in secure robotics by offering a quantifiable and comprehensive evaluation method encompassing technical and human-centric aspects. Its adoption promotes
a balanced approach to robotics design and aligns with societal values and ethical standards.
6.4 Determining the Weightings in the Secure Robotics Model
Determining weightings in the secure robotics model is a critical process that requires a multidisciplinary approach. These weightings reflect the relative importance of each component (i.e.,
cybersecurity, trust, safety, ethical considerations, and human factors) in a given robotic application. Several factors, including the operational context of the robot, stakeholder priorities, and
regulatory requirements, can influence the derivation of these weights.
6.4.1 Operational Context. The operational context of the robotic system plays a pivotal role
in determining the weightings. For instance, safety may be given the highest weight in a healthcare setting due to the critical nature of medical procedures. Conversely, human factors and trust
may be emphasised in a consumer-based application like a home assistant robot to ensure userfriendliness and acceptance. Analysing the operational environment, intended usage, and potential
risks associated with the robotic system is fundamental in assigning appropriate weights to each
component.
6.4.2 Stakeholder Priorities. Stakeholder priorities are essential in shaping the weightings and
involve consulting with various stakeholders (e.g., end-users, manufacturers, regulatory bodies,
and domain experts) to understand their concerns and expectations. For example, regulatory bodies may emphasise cybersecurity and ethical considerations, while end-users may prioritise trust
and human factors. Engaging with stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and workshops can
provide valuable insights into the aspects they consider most critical, which can then be reflected
in the weightings.
6.4.3 Regulatory Requirements. Regulatory requirements and industry standards often dictate
certain minimum levels of compliance, particularly in areas like safety and cybersecurity. These
requirements can act as baseline determinants for the weightings. For instance, the safety component naturally carries significant weight in industries with stringent safety regulations (e.g.,
aviation and nuclear energy). Similarly, cybersecurity is heavily weighted in sectors where data
protection and privacy are paramount. A thorough review of relevant regulations and standards
can ensure that the weightings align with legal and industry-specific mandates.
6.4.4 Iterative Refinement. The process of deriving these weightings is not static; it should be
iterative and adaptable. As the field of robotics evolves and more data are available, the weightings
can be adjusted to reflect new insights, technological advancements, and changing societal values.
This iterative process allows the model to remain relevant and accurate over time.
6.4.5 Empirical Validation. Empirical validation is crucial in confirming the appropriateness of
the weightings. It involvestesting the model in real-world scenarios, analysing its predictive power
and accuracy, and adjusting based on the outcomes. The feedback loop from empirical testing
ensures that the weightings are grounded in practical reality and effectively capture the nuances
of secure robotics.
7 Contextual Example: Robotic Surgical Assistant
In the context of a robotic surgical assistant, the emphasis on safety and trust is paramount and
reflects the critical nature of medical procedures and the reliance placed on these systems by
healthcare professionals and patients. The development and implementation of robotic surgery
systems necessitate rigorous safety protocols and training to enhance team efficiency, situational
awareness, decision-making, leadership, communication, and teamwork. These elements are crucial for hospitals with robotic capabilities to develop emergency safety protocols and provide relevant training and simulation opportunities. Such initiatives support cohesive responses in lifethreatening patient events and reduce errors and process disruptions in high-pressure scenarios.
Moreover, training in closed-loop communication is highlighted as a strategy to promote increased
patient safety by focusing on simple and standardised procedures for message transmission, reception, and verification among team members [148].
Additionally, safety systems integrated into surgical robotics, such as those developed by
Medical Microinstruments, address-critical aspects like secure connectivity and user error. These
systems are designed to enhance surgeons’ performance while safeguarding patients from errors
or malfunctions, including features like electromagnetic reference fields to track surgeons’ hand
movements, software to smooth hand tremors, and emergency stop buttons as examples of
how surgical robotics aim to mitigate risks associated with user error and system malfunctions.
The focus on cybersecurity and the prevention of unauthorised access to these systems further
exemplifies the comprehensive approach to ensuring the safety and reliability of robotic surgical
assistants [149].
Noting the emphasis ofsafety on trust, the weights assigned to each component—safety (S), trust
(T), cybersecurity (C), ethical considerations (E), and human factors (H)—are determined based on
their relative importance to the successful operation and acceptance of robotic surgical assistants.
• Safety (S) is the highest priority, which reflects the critical need for the robotic system to
perform surgeries without causing harm to patients.
• Trust (T) follows in priority, which underscores the importance of reliability and the system’s ability to perform as expected under various conditions.
• Cybersecurity (C) is the next priority, which highlights the need to protect patient data and
ensure the system is resistant to unauthorised access or tampering.
• Ethical considerations (E) and human factors (H) receive the lowest weightings. While
they are important for ensuring the system is used ethically and is designed with user
ergonomics in mind, they are deemed less critical than safety, trust, and cybersecurity in
this context.
The calculated overall secure robotics measure R integrates these weighted components to offer
a quantifiable assessment of the robotic surgical assistant’s security and performance. This model
allows stakeholders to evaluate the system’s readiness and identify areas for improvement to ensure that the robotic surgical assistant is effective and aligned with ethical standards to foster trust
among users and enhance patient safety.
7.1 Composite Security Measurement Model Application in Accreditation Activities
An accreditation pathway for robotic surgical assistants, grounded in the evaluation framework
provided by the Composite Security Measurement Model, is useful for integrating technological
innovations into clinical practice. This model’s application in the accreditation process ensures a
comprehensive assessment ofsafety, efficacy, and security while confirming the system’sreadiness
for clinical deployment and setting a benchmark for continuous enhancement in robotic-assisted
surgeries. It provides a structured and objective method for assessing compliance with healthcare
regulations and performance standards. Accreditation based on such a robust evaluative framework significantly enhances robotic surgical assistants’ marketability and adoption rates within
the healthcare sector. It testifies to the system’s reliability and effectiveness, which can open avenues for commercialisation by demonstrating its potential to improve surgical precision, reduce
operational risks, and facilitate quicker patient recovery. This formal validation is crucial for encouraging healthcare facilities to adopt these advanced technological solutions. A collaborative
effort among developers,regulatory bodies, and healthcare institutionsis vital forsuccessfully navigating the accreditation and commercialisation processes. This partnership seeks to ensure that
introducing robotic surgical assistants into medical practice is smooth and advantageous by leveraging the accreditation as a marker of the system’s contribution to enhancing patient care through
technological innovation. Thus, the commercialisation of accredited robotic surgical systems has
the potential to set new standards for medical technology and promote broader acceptance and
integration of innovative solutions that promise to advance surgical outcomes and patient care.
7.2 The Rationale Behind Weight Distribution
The allocation of weights in the secure robotics model, particularly for a robotic surgical assistant, is a nuanced decision that balances various critical factors to optimise the system’s overall
performance and acceptance. While each component—safety (S), trust (T), cybersecurity (C), ethical considerations (E), and human factors (H)—is vital to the system’s success, the highest weight
cannot be assigned to all components simultaneously due to the unique demands and priorities of
each application. Here are the reasons for the chosen weight distribution:
• Safety (S) is assigned the highest weight because the primary objective of a robotic surgical
assistant is to aid in medical procedures without causing harm. In the context of surgery,
even minor errors can have significant consequences, so safety is paramount. The weight
reflects the imperative to minimise risks and protect patients during surgical operations.
• Trust (T) receives the second-highest weight due to the importance of reliability and predictability in medical settings. Surgeons and medical staff must have confidence in the
robotic assistant’s capabilities and consistency. Trust facilitates the integration of robotic
systems into sensitive healthcare environments where the stakes are high, and errors can
have dire implications.
• Cybersecurity (C), while critical, is weighted slightly lowerthan safety and trust. Protecting
patient data and ensuring the integrity of the robotic system against cyber threats is essential. However, in the immediate context of surgical procedures, the direct impact on patient
safety and operational reliability takes precedence. Cybersecurity ensures the system’s resilience against external threats but is considered in conjunction with physical safety and
trustworthiness.
• Ethical considerations(E) and human factors(H) are equally important but are assigned the
lowest weight in this context. Ethical use and ergonomic design are fundamental for ensuring the system’s responsible deployment and user-friendliness. However, in the surgical
setting, where immediate safety and trust are critical, these components, while essential for
holistic evaluation, are secondary to direct impact factors.
The decision not to assign the highest weight to each component is driven by the need to prioritise elements that are most critical to the immediate success and acceptance of the robotic surgical
assistant. This prioritisation is crucial for addressing the most pressing concerns in surgical settings, such as patient safety and system reliability. The approach allows stakeholders to focus on
optimising key areas directly influencing surgical outcomes and patient care to ensure the robotic
surgical assistant achieves its intended purpose effectively and safely.
7.3 Determining Component Weights
Deciding the weight to assign to each component in a secure robotics model, such as for a robotic
surgical assistant, involves a methodical approach considering the robotic system’s specific objectives, context, and requirements. This section outlines the key steps and considerations in determining the appropriate weights for cybersecurity (C), trust (T), safety (S), ethical considerations
(E), and human factors (H).
7.3.1 Assessment of Operational Needs and Risks. The first step involves thoroughly assessing
the robotic system’s operational environment and the associated risks. For a robotic surgical assistant, the primary focusis on patientsafety and the precision ofsurgical procedures. Identifying the
operational needs and potential risks helps prioritise the components most critical to the system’s
success that should be weighted more heavily.
7.3.2 Stakeholder Consultation. Consulting with stakeholders (e.g., surgeons, nursing staff,
hospital administrators, patients, regulatory bodies, and technology developers) provides diverse
perspectives on what is most important in the robotic system’s operation. Stakeholder priorities
vary significantly. For example, medical staff may prioritise safety and trust, while regulatory
bodies may emphasise compliance with ethical standards. Stakeholder consultation helps balance
these diverse priorities in the weighting process.
7.3.3 Review of Regulatory and Ethical Standards. Regulatory requirements and ethical standards specific to healthcare and robotic assistance provide a framework for determining minimum
acceptable levels for certain components. For instance, stringent safety regulations in healthcare
may necessitate a higher weight for safety. Similarly, laws governing data protection may dictate
the minimum weight for cybersecurity. Compliance with these standards ensures that the robotic
system meets essential legal and ethical benchmarks.
7.3.4 Empirical Evidence and Benchmarking. Analysing empirical evidence from studies, trials,
and the performance of existing robotic systems can offer insights into the impact of various components on system effectiveness and user satisfaction. Benchmarking against industry standards
and leading practices in similar technologies allows for an evidence-based approach to weight
allocation to ensure the model is grounded in real-world performance data.
7.3.5 Iterative Refinement and Feedback Loops. Given the rapid advancements in robotics and
changing societal values, the weight assignment is not a one-time decision but requires iterative
refinement. Continuous feedback from system deployment, UX, and technological developments
must inform weight adjustments. This iterative process allows the model to adapt to new insights
so that it remains relevant and effective over time.
7.3.6 Quantitative Analysis and Modelling. Quantitative methods (e.g., multi-criteria decision
analysis) can be employed to systematically evaluate and rank the importance of each component based on predefined criteria. This approach provides a structured and transparent method
for weight determination, which leverages statistical and mathematical tools to support decisionmaking.
Hence, deciding which weight to assign to each component in a secure robotics model is a
multifaceted process that integrates operational assessments, stakeholder input, regulatory compliance, empirical evidence, and quantitative analysis. This comprehensive approach ensures that
the weight assignment is well-informed, balanced, and capable of guiding the development of
robotic systems that meet high safety, reliability, and ethical responsibility standards.

• Maintenance: The ongoing application of the model facilitates the continuous improvement
of the robotic system by adapting to new threats, technological advancements, and user
feedback.
7.4.2 Validation Using Empirical Testing. Empirical testing plays a crucial role in validating the
secure robotics model, which involves the following:
• Field trials deploy the robotic surgical assistant in controlled clinical environments to monitor its performance, safety levels, and user satisfaction in real-world surgical procedures.
• Feedback collection gathers qualitative and quantitative feedback from end-users, including surgeons and medical staff, to evaluate the system’s trustworthiness and usability.
• Adjustment and refinement allow the model’s weightingsto reflect the operational realities
better and improve the system’s overall performance based on empirical evidence and user
feedback.
7.4.3 Iterative Improvement. The validation process is not a one-time activity but an ongoing
effort to ensure the robotic surgical assistant remains at the forefront of safety, security, and user
satisfaction. Iterative testing and model refinement help anticipate future challenges and adapt to
evolving medical practices and technologies.
7.5 Discussion
The model provides a structured and quantifiable approach to evaluating and optimising secure
robotic systems. The flexibility of the weight assignments allows for the model’s adaptation to different applications to ensure a comprehensive assessment that aligns with the specific operational
needs. Using hypothetical values in the examples is illustrative; these values should be based on
empirical data and domain-specific evaluations. This conceptual model serves as a foundational
tool for researchers and practitioners in the field of secure robotics to facilitate objective assessments and guide improved robotic design and deployment.
