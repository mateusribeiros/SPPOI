Title: Educational Technology in the University: A Comprehensive Look at the Role of a Professor and Artificial Intelligence

ABSTRACT This study aims to delineate the roles of professors at universities and explore the educational
applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI). With rapid advancements in AI technology, there is an increasing
effort to integrate AI and Educational Technology (EdTech) into educational practices, resulting in AI
EdTech. Higher education institutions, particularly universities, are focused on leveraging AI EdTech to
augment traditional teaching roles. Traditional educational methods often face limitations in providing
personalized learning experiences, whereas AI EdTech offers promising solutions to enhance these methods
and provide immersive learning opportunities for students. Currently, various universities independently
pursue the implementation of AI EdTech. However, for AI EdTech to be successfully established and
widely adopted in higher education, key factors such as maintenance costs and the potential for continuous
development should be considered. Therefore, the standardization and development of AI EdTech systems
that can be universally applied across universities are essential. In this regard, this study defines the core
roles of professors and proposes developmental levels for AI professors to complement these roles. It also
outlines the necessary Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for each level of AI professor development. These
initiatives are expected to play a crucial role in the future standardization and research development of AI
EdTech systems.

I. INTRODUCTION
The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought significant innovations across multiple industries, with education
being one of the most impacted areas [1], [2], [3], [4].
AI-driven Educational Technology (AI EdTech), which
refers to the application of AI technologies in educational
tools and platforms, promises to revolutionize traditional
educational methods [5], [6]. Recent advancements in Large
Language Models (LLMs)1
and the emergence of generative
AI2 have significantly accelerated the development of AI
EdTech [7], [8], [9]. In particular, there have been numerous instances of applying OpenAI3
technologies, such as
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), in educational
settings. Specifically, Khan Academy has introduced an AI
EdTech service called Khanmigo, which leverages OpenAI
to enhance its educational offerings [10]. Also, ChatGPT
Education (ChatGPT Edu) [11], which is a version of
ChatGPT built for universities to responsibly deploy AI to
students, faculty, researchers, and campus operations, was
launched recently. Also, Google provides Learning Language
Model (LearnLM) which is an AI language model fine-tuned
for learning, and grounded in educational research to make
teaching and learning experiences more active, personal and
engaging [12]. In addition, copilot for Microsoft integrates
AI capabilities for educators and students into everyday
applications like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Teams [13].
Recent studies have highlighted the potential benefits of AI
EdTech [14], [15], [16]. These include personalized learning
experiences, improved accessibility, efficient administrative
processes, and addressing teacher shortage [17], [18]. For
instance, AI algorithms can analyze student data to tailor educational content to individual learning styles and
paces [19], [20]. Therefore, AI EdTech is being applied
in K-124
education in various innovative ways, aimed at
enhancing personalized learning, supporting educators, and
improving administrative efficiency. For example, digital
textbooks for K-12 in South Korea are set to be officially
implemented starting in 2025 in order to enhance both
teaching and learning experiences [21]. Also, publishers such
as Pearson [22] and McGraw-Hill [23] are striving to provide
solutions for personalized learning for students through
digital textbook-based data learning, not only for K-12
education but also for higher education. Furthermore, nonprofit associations such as Educause [24] and 1EdTech [25]
play a critical role in the education sector for effective
digital learning environments. In addiiton, AI EdTech is
also being actively adopted by many universities around
the world. In particular, Arizona State University (ASU)
has partnered with OpenAI to integrate advanced AI tools,
including ChatGPT, into their educational programs which
focus on enhancing student success, innovative research, and
streamlining organizational processes [26].
On the other hand, there are also concerns about AI
for unintended consequences, including ethical dilemmas,
privacy breaches, and the amplification of biases [27].
Recently, current and former employees from leading AI
companies have raised concerns about the risks associated
with advanced AI technologies [28]. In the field of education
as well, it also has not been verified yet for the effectiveness
of AI Edtech [29], [30]. Also, there are many challenges
to realizing AI Edtech for higher education. In higher
education, where the size of universities varies and there is
no standardized textbook for the majors and courses offered,
the approaches to AI EdTech differ from one university to
another. Moreover, AI technology is rapidly advancing day
by day. Therefore, if the infrastructure for AI EdTech is
established through such non-standardized approaches, there
will be difficulties in continuously developing AI EdTech in
the future.
Based on the aforementioned advantages and disadvantages of AI EdTech, this paper aims to suggest the
direction that AI EdTech should take in higher education.
Specifically, we provide a comprehensive look at the role of
a professor and AI in the university. The key contributions
are: i) We first identify the roles and core competencies of a
professor (hereafter referred to as ‘‘human professor’’ which
is differentiated with ‘‘AI professor’’) and then introduce
examples of AI being applied in university education. ii) We
provide a taxonomy with detailed definitions for five levels
of AI professor, ranging from current status (Level 1) to full
AI professor (Level 5), in the context of four AI companions
including AI tutor, AI assistant, AI adviser, and AI professor.
iii) We provide key capabilities and requirements according
to the level evolution of the AI professor. Importantly,
we present the educational and technical issues that AI
EdTech faces when applied to higher education and propose
future directions to these problems.
Given the importance of this topic, the paper is structured
as follows: Section II examines the current state of university
education, detailing the roles of traditional human professors
and the recent incorporation of AI EdTech. Section III
explores the various stages of AI professor development in
universities, outlining the essential capabilities and requirements at each stage. Section IV addresses the challenges
involved in realizing AI professors. Finally, Section V
provides the conclusion.
II. EDUCATION IN THE UNIVERSITY
In this section, we present the job competencies of a human
professor in five key aspects and provide examples of AI
EdTech that support these competencies.
A. THE JOB COMPETENCIES OF A PROFESSOR
The role of a university professor is diverse and can vary
significantly depending on their field of study [31]. For
example, professors in the humanities and social sciences
emphasize critical thinking, analysis, and interpretive skills.
In contrast, those in Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics (STEM) focus on experimental techniques and
problem-solving. However, the job competencies of professors, as presented in Fig. 1, are generally applicable across
all fields. A detailed explanation of each job competency is
provided below:
1) Expertise in the relevant field: This is a fundamental
requirement for professors. Specifically, professors
should possess deep knowledge and skills in their
subject areas to provide accurate and comprehensive
education [32]. This expertise ensures that students
receive high-quality instruction grounded in current
research and practice. In contemporary educational
settings, the role of professors encompasses a wide
FIGURE 1. Job compentencies of a professor.
array of competencies that are crucial for effective
teaching and learning.
2) Class structuring skill: Planning and preparing class
materials is a core competency for professors [33].
Initially, professors should select a subject and then
establish goals and a plan. The next step involves
preparing the teaching materials. Analyzing students’
backgrounds is crucial for delivering student-tailored
education [34]. Essentially, the class should be prepared after understanding students’ needs and prior
knowledge. However, in traditional educational settings where one teacher instructs many students, it is
challenging to prepare lessons tailored to the individual
backgrounds of each student.
3) Teaching skill: Studies in [35], [36], and [37]
consistently demonstrate that good teaching skills
positively impact student learning and motivation.
Effective teaching includes not only lectures but also
discussions with students during class. Customized
tutoring can be achieved through discussions and Q&A
sessions. However, current typical teaching methods
have limitations in providing customized tutoring to
all students. Despite this, professors must employ
diverse strategies tailored to various learning styles
to maintain student engagement and facilitate deeper
understanding.
4) Learning assessment skill: Learning assessment
involves developing exams and assignments, monitoring students’ progress, and ultimately grading.
According to [38], students’ academic achievements
increase significantly when they receive constructive and continuous personalized feedback. However,
in current typical assessment processes, it is practically difficult to evaluate students by reflecting their
individual characteristics and providing personalized
feedback. Effective assessment strategies will help
students understand their progress and identify areas
for improvement.
FIGURE 2. An examples of AI companions.
5) Communication skill: Professors need to communicate frequently with students to provide guidance
about courses, careers, and research areas. According
to [39], students regard professors’ ability to communicate and interact effectively with them as the most
essential competency. Effective communication fosters
a supportive learning environment, enabling students
to engage actively and feel valued. Professors should
not only teach academic content but also contribute
to shaping students’ personalities and guiding them to
become desirable members of society. This guidance
helps students navigate their career paths and develop
into well-rounded individuals [40], [41]. However, due
to the busy schedules of professors, the time available
for communication with students decreases, and it is
easy to overlook the importance of this interaction.
There is no doubt that the five competencies described
above are essential for professors in universities. However,
as mentioned earlier, there are practical limitations to
providing customized class structuring, teaching, learning
assessment, and communication skills to students through
traditional educational methods. Therefore, the next section
will explore efforts to overcome these limitations by utilizing
recent advancements in AI EdTech.
B. AI EDTECH
In the previous section, we explained the limitations of traditional teaching methods by human professors in providing
personalized education. The positive effects of personalized
education are already well known [42]. Consequently, many
universities and educational institutions are considering AI
EdTech as a solution to address these challenges [2], [5].
Specifically, many universities are implementing AI EdTech
services such as AI assistants, AI tutors, and AI advisers,
as illustrated in Fig. 2. From our understanding, AI assistants,
AI tutors, and AI advisers can all be collectively referred to
as AI professors, as their roles align with the competencies of
human professors described in Section II-A. Therefore, in this
paper, we define AI assistants, AI tutors, AI advisers, and AI
professors collectively as AI companions which provide AI
EdTech services in the university. Below, we describe specific
cases where these AI companions are applied.
Firstly, an AI assistant helps human professors with class
structuring and learning assessment, as illustrated in Fig. 2.
It is also beneficial for students by providing instant feedback
on assignments and tests, allowing them to understand their
mistakes and learn promptly. Automated grading systems for
essays, quizzes, and coding assignments ensure that students
receive timely and constructive feedback, enhancing their
learning process [43]. The AI assistant facilitates access to
a vast array of online resources and learning materials, aiding
human professors in preparing lectures. It can help professors
find relevant textbooks, research papers, and multimedia content tailored to their current classes and research interests [5].
Tools like Quizbot (Stanford University) [44] automatically
generate quizzes for professors. Additionally, platforms such
as Knewton (ASU) [45] and Cerego (University of Califonia,
Berkeley) [46] assess student levels through grading and
provide personalized learning materials. The LIVECAT
platform [47] in the Hallym university evaluates the students’
ability and latent traits based on computerized adaptive
testing.
Secondly, an AI tutor assists human professors in teaching,
as illustrated in Fig. 2. AI tutors can personalize instruction
to meet individual students’ needs, preferences, and learning
paces. They tailor instructional materials, assignments, and
assessments, ensuring each student engages with content
at an appropriate difficulty level. This customization helps
students understand complex concepts better and progress
more effectively [42]. AI tools such as virtual reality (VR)
and augmented reality (AR) provide immersive learning
experiences, making complex subjects more engaging and
easier to understand [48]. For instance, biology students can
explore 3D models of the human body, while history students
can experience historical events through VR simulations[49].
Advanced applications include L2TOR [50], where classes
are conducted through Cobot [51], a robot capable of
interacting with humans, and programs like DeepTutor
(Carnegie Mellon University) [52] and AutoTutor (University
of Memphis) [53], which uses natural language processing
to deliver lectures, personalized assessments, and feedback
without human intervention [43]. For example, Assessment
and Learning in Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS) [54] is an
adaptive learning platform used by ASU to help students in
various subjects, particularly mathematics. Squirrel AI [55]
at Tsinghua university continuously monitors student performance and adjusts the difficulty and focus areas in real-time
to ensure optimal learning.
Thirdly, an AI advisor helps human professors communicate with students, as illustrated in Fig. 2. An AI
advisor can provide guidance about courses, careers, and
research areas. Additionally, AI advisors can streamline
administrative tasks such as scheduling, enrollment, and
resource allocation. Chatbots and virtual assistants can
handle routine queries from students, allowing faculty
and administrative staff to focus on more critical tasks,
thus creating a smoother educational experience for students [5]. AI advisors can facilitate better collaboration
among students through intelligent communication platforms
that manage group projects, track contributions, and suggest
optimal workflows. These tools help students work together
more efficiently, fostering teamwork and project management
skills [42]. AI advisor platforms such as Pounce (Georgia
State University) [56], and EduBot (Deakin University) [57]
support continuous learning beyond college by providing
personalized recommendations for courses, reading materials, and skill development opportunities based on a student’s
evolving interests and career goals. This lifelong learning
approach ensures that students remain competitive and
adaptable in their professional lives.
Finally, AI assistants, AI tutors, and AI advisers can be
integrated into an AI professor, as shown in Fig. 2. Alternatively, the term AI professor can be another name for these
three AI companions, representing a key AI EdTech service
in the future. To ensure that AI professors are meaningfully
utilized in future university education, it is necessary to
consider the current state of technological development and
the future direction of evolution. Additionally, it is essential
to identify the technical and educational elements required
for this evolution. These aspects will be discussed further in
the following section.
III. AI PROFESSOR
In this section, we discuss how AI EdTech is expected to
evolve in the future, potentially taking over certain roles
traditionally held by human professors in universities. Next,
we outline the necessary capabilities and requirements for
this development.
A. THE LEVELS OF AI PROFESSOR
Traditionally, human professors had handled all teaching tasks entirely without AI assistance. This traditional
approach relies solely on the professor’s competencies (See
Section II-A) to deliver education. However, as we explained
in Section II-B, AI EdTech is currently applied in many universities to provide a better education to students. At the end,
the final goal of AI EdTech would be an AI professor which
realizes full automation of human professors’ role in the wide
areas of fields and courses as much as possible. Inspired by
the levels of automation in self-driving cars [58] and Aritificial General Intelligene (AGI) [59], we propose structuring
the concept of AI professors similarly. At first, traditional
teaching methods belong to Level 0 where human professors
does not use AI assistance and utilize basic tools only such
as authoring tools and traditional Learning Management
Systems (LMS). With AI assistance, the evolution level of the
AI professor can be categorized from Level 1 (Current status)
to Level 5 (full automation) as shown in Fig. 3. Specifically,
we explain about the taxonomy of five levels on AI
professor as:
FIGURE 3. The evolution levels for an AI professor.
1) Level 1 (Simple AI Assistance for Learning):
Level 1 is the current status. At Level 1, the state-ofthe-art AI in EdTech can offer basic functions of AI
companions as illustrated in Fig. 3. However, at this
level, AI EdTech does not provide satisfactory services
on its own. Human professors should lead all teaching
activities and maintain direct interaction with students
to ensure effective learning.
2) Level 2 (Preset Level-Based Customized Learning):
At Level 2, AI EdTech offers customized AI companions which work based on pre-established levels. For
example, levels can be divided into three categories:
high, medium, and low. An AI tutor assesses the
student’s level, and based on this, the student can
choose the desired level. Accordingly, the AI assistant
creates and evaluates exam questions and assignments
suitable for the chosen level. One important function at
this level is the ability to interact closely with students,
which significantly increases satisfaction.5
3) Level 3 (Personal Goal Setting and Progress-Based
Customized Learning): Level 3 offers personally
customized AI companions. Unlike Level 2, Level
3 features customized learning based on individual
goals and progress. Recognizing that each student has
unique objectives, Level 3’s AI companions begin
by identifying these goals and then provide services
specifically designed to achieve them according to the
progress of learning. AI EdTech integrates extensive
datasets, advanced analytics, and cutting-edge AI
technologies to offer highly customized services as
illustrated in Fig. 3. Additionally, advanced multimedia technologies such as AR, VR, and holograms
provide immersive learning opportunities for students.
However, human professors should still maintain their
leadership roles, using the outputs from AI companions
to inform their teaching decisions and monitor student
progress.
4) Level 4 (High Automation of AI Professor): Level
4 represents a high degree of automation in AI
professor capabilities, allowing for minimal human
management and supervision in selected fields and
courses. At this stage, all AI companions can be
integrated into a single AI professor, signifying that all
functions of the AI companions are highly stabilized
and seamlessly merged. However, human professors
still need to supervise the AI companions when making
important decisions and to address any malfunctions.
5) Level 5 (Full Automation of AI Professor):
At Level 5, full automation is achieved, and human
professors will not be required to supervise AI
companions. Compared to Level 4, AI professors at
this stage can operate across a diverse array of fields
and courseware.6
The emergence of AI professors does not signal the end
of human professors. Human professors are still necessary
to address areas where AI may struggle and to manage
and supervise AI companions [62], ensuring their accuracy and safety–a topic discussed in the next subsection.
Additionally, human intervention in AI EdTech is crucial to
mitigate potential side effects, as explored in Section IV-A.
Therefore, the collaboration between human and AI professors could foster a more advanced higher education
environment in the future.
B. KEY CAPABILITIES AND REQUIREMENTS
As explained in the previous section, the ultimate goal of
AI EdTech in the university is to develop an AI professor,
which integrates the roles of AI assistant, AI tutor, and
AI adviser, collectively known as AI companions. The
evolution of these AI companions relies on the following key
capabilities:
• AI accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions
made by AI companions out of the total number of
predictions.
• AI safety: The evaluation of technical, ethical, and
operational aspects to ensure that the responses of AI
companions are reliable, trustworthy, and aligned with
human values.
• Hardware performance: The performance evaluated
by the combined capabilities of hardware components,
including Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Tensor
Processing Units (TPUs), custom AI chip, cloud infrastructure, edge computing devices, and high-resolution
and accurate displays.
• Software performance: The performance is evaluated
based on the combined capabilities of software components, including the Natural Language Processing (NLP)
technologies, adaptive learning algorithms, multimedia
software for AR and VR, and high-speed, low-latency
networks.
• Professor satisfaction: The evaluation of human professors’ satisfaction after integrating AI companions into
their teaching.
• Student satisfaction: The evaluation of students’ satisfaction after using AI companions in their learning.
• Sustainability: Evaluating the extent of support for
lifelong education through continuous updates and
expansions of AI EdTech and resources
• Interoperability: Evaluating the seamless integration of
AI EdTech solutions with existing systems and future
technologies
• The amount of courseware: The number of coursewares aiming to enhance the AI EdTech experience for
teaching and learning.
As the AI professor advances to higher levels, it is expected
to offer significantly enhanced capabilities compared to the
lower levels. The capabilities of the AI professor and its Key
Performance Indicators (KPIs) are illustrated in Fig. 4, which
compares the KPIs as the AI professor’s level increases.
The values in Fig. 4 serve as targets for research and
investigation and may be revised based on future studies. The
specific targets and corresponding requirements are detailed
below.
FIGURE 4. Key capabilitis and corresponding requirements for an AI
professor.
The Level 1 (i.e., current level) of AI accuracy and safety
for the task of AI companions is not expected to reach more
than 60% due to the lack of data sets on higher education.
However, the goal is to achieve an accuracy and safety rate
of 99.9999% at Level 5, eliminating the need for human professors to supervise AI companions. To enhance AI accuracy,
it is crucial to acquire extensive datasets that include teaching
materials, students’ backgrounds and progress, job market
and graduates’ information, research trends, and more.
Additionally, fine-tuning LLMs can optimize pre-trained
model parameters by adjusting them to specific datasets for
AI EdTech purposes. Customizing general-purpose LLMs
for specific purposes is essential [63], employing techniques
such as Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) [64] and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [65]. AI EdTech
systems must be trained, controlled, and managed to ensure
they provide safe responses to students. Here, ‘safety’ is a
broad concept that includes reliability, controllability, alignment with human values, bias mitigation within datasets, and
governance [66], [67]. Therefore, developing enhancement
technologies for AI accuracy and safety involves Human-InThe-Loop (HITL) approaches (utilizing expert feedback and
domain knowledge) [68] and selective prediction [69].
The convergence of advanced hardware and sophisticated
software in AI EdTech is revolutionizing the education
sector. Significant strides have been made in AI hardware
technology, yet continued development is essential to address
current limitations in computational efficiency [70], scalability [71], and energy consumption [72]. In terms of AI
software, OpenAI has recently established a set of five levels
to track its progress, with the current status estimated at
Level 1, which supports chatbots [73]. Additionally, ultimate
multimedia services via AR, VR, and high-fidelity holograms
are crucial for immersive educational experiences. However,
these services face critical obstacles due to both hardware and
software limitations [74]. In particular, hardware evolution is
needed for advanced device form-factors, such as handheld
components, to support mobile and active software content.
Current mobile devices lack sufficient stand-alone computing
capability. Unfortunately, progress in hardware performance,
especially mobile computing power and battery capacity,
cannot keep pace with the demands of ultimate multimedia
services with AI EdTech. This discrepancy could severely
hinder market expansion. We believe these hardware challenges can be overcome by offloading computing to more
powerful devices or servers. For instance, the scalability
of cloud solutions combined with powerful edge devices
ensures that ultimate multimedia services are accessible
across various educational settings, from urban schools
to remote learning environments. On the software front,
another challenge is sufficient wireless capacity. Current
AR technology requires 55.3 megabits per second (Mbps)
to support an 8K display (with one million points), which
provides an adequate user experience on a mobile display.
However, to provide a truly immersive AR experience,
the density must be significantly improved, requiring
0.44 gigabits per second (Gbps) throughput (with 16 million
points). Additionally, a human-sized hologram demands
a significantly large number of pixels, requiring several
terabits per second (Tbps) [75]. The current user-experienced
data rate of 5G is insufficient to support these services.
Therefore, both hardware and software technologies must
be further developed to realize personalized learning, realtime feedback, and immersive educational experiences,
enhancing both teaching and learning outcomes, as depicted
in Fig. 4.
In higher education, the purpose of AI Edtech is to
provide high satisfaction for both professors and students
by integrating AI companions into teaching and learning.
As explained in Fig. 4, the current Level 1 of AI EdTech
only offers simple services, with an anticipated satisfaction
rate not exceeding 50%. Many universities view AI EdTech
as a significant driver of academic innovation, leading
to the implementation of AI companions, as detailed in
Section II-B. The primary goal of AI EdTech is to evolve
in a way that enhances the satisfaction of both professors
and students. To increase professors’ satisfaction, AI EdTech
should significantly reduce their workload, allowing them to
focus more on research and devote more attention to students.
For students, personalized education through AI EdTech
must be prioritized to enhance their satisfaction. Additionally,
diverse learning experiences should be provided through
advancements in AI and multimedia technologies. These
improvements in education quality can lead to increased
student satisfaction and a reduction in dropout rates. As illustrated in Fig. 4, achieving a 90% satisfaction rate for
both professors and students at Level 5 demonstrates the
educational effectiveness of AI EdTech.
At present, AI companions at Level 1 are not being
developed with considerations for sustainability and interoperability. However, as AI EdTech continues to evolve
and seeks widespread adoption in many universities, these
two factors become crucial. The optimal approach to
achieving sustainability and interoperability is through the
standardization of AI EdTech. When stakeholders involved
in developing and implementing AI EdTech collaborate
to standardize it, AI EdTech is expected to successfully
integrate into university systems. Consequently, at Level 5,
the achievement rate for sustainability and interoperability
should exceed 90%, as depicted in Fig. 4.
Assuming undergraduate students take roughly 40 courses
and there are 100 majors in a four-year university, the total
number of courses would be 4,000. In higher education,
which emphasizes autonomy, the same course can be taught
in diverse ways depending on the professor’s competency and
judgment. This diversity presents challenges in developing
courseware for higher education, as there can be multiple
courseware options for each course. Currently, courseware
development is focused on specific subjects that are conducive to applying AI EdTech at Level 1. For example,
it is limited to subjects like coding in computer science,
mathematics, and chemistry [76]. However, as AI EdTech
evolves to higher levels, there will be a need for courseware
to be applied across a broader range of fields. The number
of supported courseware offerings should also increase,
as shown in Fig. 4. To achieve this, efforts are required
to gather data on various subjects and develop courseware
accordingly. This involves creating a comprehensive database
of educational content and leveraging AI to generate diverse
and effective courseware that can cater to the wide range of
subjects offered in universities.
IV. MAJOR CHALLENGES FOR MAKING AI
PROFESSOR A REALITY
Despite the potential benefits of the AI professor, educational
and technical issues remain for its successful integration into
higher education. This paper raises two questions to discuss
the potential issues and to suggest future directions of the AI
professor.
A. IS AI PROFESSOR EDUCATIONALLY EFFECTIVE?
To ensure the successful integration and widespread utilization of AI professors in universities, the educational
effectiveness of AI professors should be clearly validated. However, there is currently limited evidence on the
large-scale adoption and effectiveness of AI professors in an
educational context [77], and there are concerns about the
following:
• Restriction for self-regulated learning
• Loss of human interaction
• Exacerbating educational inequities
First, a highly developed AI professor may limit opportunities and affordances for self-regulated learning for some
students [78]. Self-regulated learning refers to the process by
which students personally activate and maintain cognitions
and behaviors systematically directed toward achieving
academic learning goals [79]. According to the theory of
self-regulated learning, learners evaluate the effectiveness of
their own learning methods or strategies during the learning
process and make appropriate adjustments through internal
changes or behavior modification [79]. The personalized
learning approach driven by AI professors is based on
individual preferences and activity data. From the perspective
of behaviorism, AI can be seen as a tool that restricts learners’
opportunities to explore and evaluate diverse strategies and
methodologies within the learning process. AI analyzes
learners’ behavioral patterns, suggests learning plans, and
provides feedback based on a set algorithm. This makes
learners more likely to adhere to the rules set by the system
and follow the learning path suggested by the AI rather than
explore new ways to learn. In other words, a student assisted
by an AI professor may experience customized learning while
simultaneously decreasing their ability to set, explore, and
evaluate their own goals. Additionally, generative AI still has
the potential to create misleading or misinformative content
or provide too much or too little feedback. If learners rely
too heavily on the technology, they may encounter inaccurate
learning resources or receive inconsistent or inappropriate
feedback based solely on information generated by AI, rather
than exploring and evaluating learning resources themselves
to modify their behavior. This can limit self-regulated
learning and reduce the quality of learning [80].
Another concern regarding AI professors is the potential
reduction in human interaction between students and human
professors. While AI professors can efficiently deliver
personalized content, they cannot replicate the empathy,
mentorship, and nuanced understanding that human professors provide. This loss of human interaction can lead
to a less engaging and supportive learning environment,
which is particularly detrimental during the university years,
a critical period for emotional and social development [81].
The emotion learners experience during the learning process
affects not only their psychological stability but also their
learning satisfaction, academic performance, and more [82].
If AI professors can understand and respond to learners’
emotions, they can increase learner participation and reduce
dropouts. Positive effects can be expected in terms of providing customized feedback, enhancing learning motivation, and
offering psychological support.
In addition, a concern with AI professors is the issue
of educational inequality. This is known as the Matthew
effect [83], which suggests that learners who benefit the most
from the use of new technologies are those who already
possess wealth, existing levels of education, and familiarity
with technology. This means that new resources, even free
online resources, will be utilized most effectively by learners
who already have access to technology and know how
to use it [84]. This phenomenon has become even more
pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic, as schools
around the world transitioned to remote learning [85].
Students with access to computers and the Internet were able
to quickly adapt to remote learning and had easier access
to online learning platforms [86]. Conversely, students with
limited access to technology not only had restricted access
to their classes but also had to spend more time setting up
digital learning environments, which detracted from their
actual learning time [87], [88]. Despite efforts to bridge
the gap between students and achieve equitable education,
public education has shown a tendency to exacerbate this gap
through the adoption of technology. Without understanding
this phenomenon, AI professors have the potential to worsen
existing disparities in the education system.
Based on the aforementioned issues, we provide future
directions for AI professors in the educational aspect as
follows:
• Intentional and collaborative design of AI professor
• Verification on the effectiveness of AI professor
• Involvement of human professor
First, for AI professors to facilitate effective learning
in online, hybrid, and in-person environments, intentional
design is required [89], [90]. Specifically, the AI professor
should be designed to promote self-regulated learning. This
can be achieved through appropriate fine-tuning when AI
is applied to education, as discussed in Section III-B.
Furthermore, AI professors should be designed intentionally
in ways that enhance students’ creativity [91]. Also, it is
essential that designs accommodate the diverse characteristics of students, including gender, abilities, learning
styles, language, and ethnicity. Enhancing the accessibility
of AI professors is a prerequisite for minimizing educational
disparities among students and fostering a healthy AI EdTech
ecosystem. The principles of Universal Design for Learning
(UDL) can be applied to this end. UDL, as provided by
CAST [92], offers an intentional and systematic framework
for considering the diversity of learners with respect to
multiple representations, behaviors and expressions, and
learning engagement. By incorporating these considerations
into the design of AI professors, barriers created by factors
such as gender, age, and disability can be broken down,
actively supporting students in achieving their learning
goals. Furthermore, collaborative design, involving human
professors, students, technicians, and policymakers in the
university, should be a key focus [6], [93]. By integrating
knowledge and visions of AI EdTech developers with the
actual needs of users, we can develop AI professors that are
accessible, adaptable, and capable of addressing real-world
challenges.
Secondly, the effectiveness of AI professors should be
rigorously evaluated and monitored. In other words, it is
necessary to verify their impact using scientific procedures
and methods, which requires further research and development. As previously mentioned, there is a lack of definitive
validation regarding the influence of AI professors in actual
educational settings [94]. Therefore, it is essential to analyze
how AI professors affect both human professors and students.
Investigating the experiences of human professors using AI
professors and demonstrating the impact on students through
rigorous scientific inquiry is crucial. Additionally, efforts
should be made to address and mitigate any adverse events
through evidence-based research.
Lastly, human professors should play a key role in effectively integrating AI professors into the classroom. While the
advancement of AI professors aims to automate some roles
of human professors, this does not negate the need for human
intervention, as discussed in Section III-A. To ensure that the
educational process within an AI-integrated classroom truly
constitutes learning, it is imperative that the human professor
assumes a leadership role in the entire learning activity [95].
This includes considering the roles, limitations, and ethical
aspects of AI professors, emphasizing the orchestrator role
of the human professor [96]. In [97], the Intelligent Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK)
framework was introduced, focusing on educators’ ability to
ethically and proficiently incorporate AI into their teaching
practices [29], [98]. This study underscores the significance
of TPACK competencies in equipping educators with the
necessary knowledge and pedagogical skills to seamlessly
integrate technology into their instructional methods. Actually, various data in higher education, such as students’
learning records, grades, behavioral patterns, career paths,
and employment, can be collected and utilized in AI, leading
to ethical issues related to safety and privacy [99]. Therefore,
even with the advent of Level 5 AI professors, human
professors need to be involved in AI EdTech to address
any issues and fill the gaps that AI cannot support. While
AI can provide valuable support and efficiency, the unique
competencies of human professors remain indispensable in
fostering holistic student development.
B. IS AI PROFESSOR TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE?
As discussed in Section III-A, the AI professor represents
the ultimate vision of AI companions that AI Edtech aims
to achieve in higher education. However, whether the AI
professor can continuously evolve to perform its expected
roles adequately is contingent upon addressing the following
technical issues as:
• AI professor stability for data utilization
• Feasibility of AI professor for reliable recognition
technology and ultimate multimedia experiences
• Scalability and flexibility of AI Edtech
First and foremost, the realization of an AI professor heavily depends on educational data. Specifically, this includes
class-related materials provided by human professors as well
as data related to students’ information. These data should
be processed and learned by AI technologies to produce
desirable outcomes in higher education. This implies that AI
technology should reliably ensure AI accuracy and AI safety
as discussed in Section III-B. Without guaranteed stability of
AI technology, achieving a Level 5 AI professor would be
challenging.
In addition, the AI professor should be able to recognize
the state of students and provide appropriate feedback, akin
to a human professor. With AI professors, students will
have a flexible learning environment where they can learn at
their own pace, free from the limitations of time and place.
An essential technology for this will be a monitoring system
that assesses student attention using a variety of methods to
increase engagement. Researchers have attempted to assess
students’ concentration and emotional states by analyzing
their eye movements. Various types of eye-tracking devices,
such as tower-mounted eye trackers, screen-based eye
trackers, head-mounted/wearable eye trackers, and mobile
eye trackers, have been developed for this purpose [100].
Recent advances in technology have made it possible to
monitor students’ concentration levels through changes in
pupil dilation or to analyze eye movement patterns to
classify students and provide feedback without the need
for additional external equipment [101], [102]. However,
the diversity of learners’ backgrounds (e.g., cultural, social,
economic, situational factors) makes it difficult to interpret
the context or nuances of learners’ statuses. For example,
if the artificial intelligence system has limited awareness
of various background factors, such as accent, dialect, and
cultural differences, it may inaccurately assess the learner’s
progress or create inconsistencies in understanding feedback
expectations[103]. These factors can impact the effectiveness
of educational services supported by AI professors. Therefore, cognitive technologies should be advanced to provide
high reliability in recognizing students’ states. Additionally,
the AI professor should offer more advanced multimedia
experiences to enhance the learning environment and educational outcomes. For instance, if services such as AR, VR,
and holograms, as discussed in Section III-B, are realized,
a ubiquitous educational environment can be provided,
enabling immersive learning experiences. However, current
technology faces limitations in delivering these ultimate
multimedia experiences.
Moreover, AI EdTech platforms should be designed to
handle increasing volumes of data and user interactions without compromising performance [104]. This requires scalable
architecture, efficient database management systems, and
robust server infrastructure. Flexibility refers to the ease
with which AI systems can be updated or reconfigured to
incorporate new features, educational content, or pedagogical
approaches. Ensuring that AI EdTech platforms are built
on modular and interoperable frameworks can enhance their
scalability and flexibility.
Based on the aforementioned issues, we here provide
future directions of the AI professor in the technical
aspect as:
• Development of an education-specialized LLM for
ensuring AI accuracy and safety
• Hardware and software technology enhancements
afforded by advances in communication, sensing,
imaging, displaying and AI
• Standardization of AI EdTech platform and service
To ensure the stability of the AI professor, as suggested
in Section III-B, the performance of AI accuracy and AI
safety must be developed to reach Level 5. This necessitates
the development of LLMs specialized in higher education.
Compared to K-12 education, higher education encompasses numerous majors and courses, and textbooks are
not standardized, making the development of a universally
applicable LLM for all higher education a challenging task.
Consequently, an approach of fine-tuning LLMs by specific major or course may be advantageous. To this end,
a HITL [68] approach, wherein human professors in each
field adjust and verify the LLMs, will be required. Furthermore, research and development of algorithms for fine-tuning
LLMs for AI Edtech is important.
Next, it is a reality that there are significant technical
limitations in enabling the AI professor to reliably recognize
the state of students and provide ultimate multimedia experiences in the educational process. For instance, if a student
deliberately engages in behaviors to evade recognition
technologies, there will be technical limitations in accurately
detecting such actions. As mentioned in Section III-B,
there may be constraints in supporting high communication
speeds necessary for realizing holograms. To overcome
these limitations, solutions must be provided through the
integration and complementary use of various technological
fields. For example, it is crucial to integrate advanced
technologies such as communication, sensing, imaging,
display, and AI to deliver enhanced hardware and software
performance.
Finally, standardization is the most effective alternative to
design the AI EdTech platform with scalability and flexibility.
If the platform and the service such as AI professors
are developed independently by each university without
standardization, maintenance and updates for these platforms
and services could become challenging. This is due to the
significant costs and resources required to build and sustain
such AI EdTech platforms and services. By pursuing the
standardization of AI EdTech with scalability and flexibility,
and continuously enhancing these standardized platforms and
services, AI EdTech can be successfully implemented in
many universities worldwide.
