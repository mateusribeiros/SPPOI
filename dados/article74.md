I. INTRODUCTION
Within the ever-changing digital landscape, the metaverse is
a ground-breaking platform that unites virtual and physical
worlds to create an immersive, interactive world [1]. This
survey paper explores the pivotal role that cutting-edge
technologies play in shaping this transformative space.
These technologies include edge learning, blockchain, sixth
generation (6G) wireless systems, semantic communication,
and large language models (LLMs). A dense layering of
technology frameworks that improves user engagement and
realism is called the metaverse [2]. The physical layer
manages the user interface for sophisticated devices like
augmented reality (AR) goggles and virtual reality (VR)
headsets that connect people to the metaverse [3]. These
devices improve user engagement by enabling smooth
interactions between the virtual and physical worlds [3].
The virtual layer, which focuses on creating immersive
virtual worlds, is essential to the metaverse’s operation
[4]. This layer creates intricate virtual environments where
users can interact with digital objects and avatars using
high-definition rendering and simulations. With a strong
foundation of blockchain technology, which secures transactions and promotes a decentralized metaverse ecosystem,
the technological layer facilitates these virtual interactions
[5]. Additionally, blockchain makes digital ownership and
identity management easier, which boosts user confidence
and participation in virtual environments [6]. LLMs are
essential for connecting advanced AI systems with user
interactions in the metaverse [7], [8]. LLMs improve the
accessibility and realism of communication by offering natural language processing, which makes metaverse interactions
more natural and captivating [9]. They make it possible to
create dynamic content. Edge learning and 6G communications further facilitate the smooth functioning of these
layers [10]. With its extremely fast speeds and low latency,
6G is expected to completely transform data transmission—
essential for real-time interactions in the metaverse [11],
[12]. In addition, edge learning optimizes responsiveness and
efficiency—two critical factors for interactive applications
that demand instantaneous system feedback—by processing
data closer to its source [10]. This survey also looks at
how these technologies are being used in a variety of
fields, including as entertainment, remote employment, and
immersive education, all of which show how the metaverse
has the power to fundamentally alter how people interact
in society. To fully utilize the potential of the metaverse,
a number of issues, including scalability, interoperability,
and privacy, must be resolved in order to realize these
applications. This survey not only demonstrates the potential
of the underlying technologies as we go ahead into this new
digital era, but it also points the way for further study and
development. This thorough analysis is a valuable tool for
researchers who want to investigate and broaden the scope
of the metaverse.

A. SELECTING AND ANALYZING REFERENCES AND
SURVEYS
A systematic review of existing literature was performed
by adhering to the guidelines set forth by the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
method (PRISMA). The primary aim of this approach is
to offer a degree of transparency in how systematic review
is conducted, which in turn enhances the credibility of the
findings. Furthermore, it supports the reproducibility of the
review process. This approach is comprised of four phases
which are Identification, Screening, Eligibility assessment,
and Inclusion [33].
1) DERIVATION AND CONSTRUCTION OF SEARCH TERMS
At the beginning of this paper, we used the following
three keywords: ‘‘Semantic Communication,’’ ‘‘6G,’’ and
‘‘Edge Learning’’—each combined separately with the term
‘‘Metaverse’’ to conduct searches on Scopus, and Web of
Science. From the initial search using the above keywords
boolean combinations ‘‘Metaverse’’ and ‘‘Semantic Communication’’, ‘‘Metaverse’’ and ‘‘6G’’, and ‘‘Metaverse’’
and ‘‘Edge Learning’’ 70 review papers published between
January 1, 2010, and February 22, 2025, were identified
from Scopus and Web of Science. After removing five
duplicate papers, a total of 65 papers remained. After reading
these 65 papers, additional research areas were identified
that should be included in our paper. These additional
research areas cover current technologies, applications and
hurdles related to the Metaverse, which are Blockchain,
Large Language Models, Digital Twin, Interplay, Minimum
Requirements, and Challenges. We selected these newly
defined search areas as new search keywords and then
conducted a second search by combining ‘‘Metaverse’’ with
each of these new terms in the following order: ‘‘Metaverse’’
and ‘‘Blockchain’’, ‘‘Metaverse’’ and Large Language Models’’, ‘‘Metaverse’’ and ‘‘Digital Twin’’, ‘‘Metaverse’’ and
‘‘Interplay’’, ‘‘Metaverse’’ and ‘‘Minimum Requirements’’,
and ‘‘Metaverse’’ and ‘‘Challenges’’.
2) IDENTIFICATION
By utilizing the identified search keywords, our search on
Scopus retrieved 488 papers, while the Web of Science
search resulted in 390 papers. Additionally, we conducted
a search on Google Scholar for the years 2022 to 2025 to
identify relevant scientific papers related to the previously
defined search terms, yielding 556 papers. The inclusion
of Google Scholar was essential to maximize the coverage
of relevant papers and articles, thereby enhancing the
comprehensiveness of this review.
3) SCREENING
We screened the initial number of 1434 papers obtained from
our search above. A total of 42 papers were excluded due
to duplication, and 1060 papers were excluded because their
titles and abstracts were not relevant to our research topic.
As a result, the total number of scientific papers obtained
from this study is 332.
4) ELIGIBILITY
Among the 332 remaining articles, 13 articles were not
available in full text, while 319 full-text articles were assessed
according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Table 2).
A total of 10 articles not related to research topic and were
therefore excluded. All articles were independently evaluated
by six reviewers, with articles evenly distributed among
Mohammad Aloudat, Abdullah Abu Madi, Abdelrahman
Soliman, Hassan Al-Mohammad, Mohammed Al Ali, and
Asma Mahgoub. Subsequently, the reviewers exchanged the
articles for a second review. In cases of disagreement or
uncertainty, a third review was conducted by Mahmoud
Barhamagi and Elias Yaacoub. The papers obtained from
databases search were re-examined again by all reviewers
in relation to the research questions. At this stage, data was
extracted and encoded using Microsoft Excel.
5) INCLUSION
309 articles were included in this review after we deducted
the number of articles and papers that were disqualified at
the eligibility stage from the total number of reviewed articles
and papers. Figure 2 shows the PRISMA flow diagram, which
shows the steps of the article selection procedure.
B. EXISTING SURVEYS
Researchers have conducted a review paper on metaverse
applications and how they could improve their service with
a roadmap for future works. However, many review papers
about metaverse tend to focus on the application itself,
without discussing its interaction with other applications or
with the metaverse technology. As a result, the context of
how the metaverse and other applications interplay with
one another may be missing. For instance, in [15], [16],
and [23], the authors conducted a comprehensive review
covering various aspects of the metaverse, semantic communication, and digital twin technologies within the context of
semantic communication. While in [15], researchers explore
the relationship between semantic communication and the
metaverse, it does not review their interaction with other
applications. Similarly, Lin et al. [17] examined the potential
of large language models and semantic communication to
enhance communication between users in the metaverse.
However, their study does not emphasize the interconnection
of these approaches within the metaverse or discuss future
challenges and directions for research. In contrast, Fu et al.
[20] focused on security issues and challenges associated
with metaverse applications, providing insights into how
they could be solved using blockchain. The survey in [25]
reviewed semantic communication and the benefit of using
it in the metaverse with the new 6G wireless communication.
In addition, the authors discussed the challenges faced by this
technology in the metaverse without digging deep into the
interplay between semantic communication and metaverse.
TABLE 2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria.
FIGURE 2. Flow chart based on the PRISMA protocol.
Moreover, we only found a few survey papers reviewing edge
learning in the metaverse. Amaizu et al. [32], discuss in their
survey the edge learning with semantic communication and
digital twin, in addition, they went through the challenges
facing these technologies. In addition, Xu et al. [14],
discussed edge learning and semantic communication as an
application in their survey, however, they did not mention
metaverse and how could these applications be implemented
in such technology. The survey in [28] reviewed digital twins,
blockchains, 6G, and edge learning as applications and how
could be achieved with the minimum requirements. However,
In contrast to other surveys, our survey takes a novel approach
by a comprehensive review of the metaverse technology
by taking into account all the different applications used
within the metaverse. These applications include semantic communication, digital twins, large language models,
blockchain, sixth-generation wireless communication, and
edge learning. In addition, we have conducted a detailed
analysis of the most recent efforts aimed at addressing the
restrictions of the metaverse in various applications. We have
identified several challenges and potential future paths, and
we summarize these based on our review of the metaverse
and its applications. We have compiled a list of challenges
that the metaverse is facing, along with possible solutions for
these challenges, and we discuss how they could be resolved
in the future. Table 1 shows a comparison of this work with
the most relevant surveys in the literature.
C. CROSS-DISCIPLINARY NATURE OF METAVERSE
RESEARCH
The metaverse is, in its essence, an interdisciplinary space
that marries advances in semantic communication, edge
computing, artificial intelligence, and telecommunications
to enable seamless, interactive virtual worlds [34]. While
technology has a central role, effortless and scalable metaverse requires interplay among a variety of disciplines,
from human-computer interaction, cognitive science, and
economics to digital governance [35]. Metaverse research
is not within a single discipline but is at the intersection
of multiple disciplines, and thus it is cross-disciplinary
in nature. Semantic communication and edge computing,
two of the primary enablers of metaverse growth, are
particularly in demand of inputs from different fields
to optimize network performance, user experience, and
computational effectiveness [35]. Recent studies show how
cross-disciplinary research advances the development of the
metaverse. For example, [34] examines the convergence of
telecommunications and economic incentive models of network resource allocation to enhance metaverse connectivity
and efficiency. Similarly, [36] highlights the synergy between
machine learning-based semantic processing, edge network
optimization, and human-computer interaction, showing the
necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration to address communication challenges. Furthermore, [37] provides a general
examination of how edge computing, AI, and blockchain all
work together to enhance metaverse scalability and security.
These examples demonstrate that metaverse research is
not just an engineering endeavor but a multi-disciplinary
convergence that requires interaction between engineers,
economists, legal scholars, psychologists, and ethicists. In the
future, a broader research perspective combining different
fields will be necessary to ensure a safe, efficient, and
user-centric metaverse environment [37].
D. OVERVIEW OF TECHNOLOGIES IN THE METAVERSE
This section provides an overview and introduction to the
metaverse enabling key technologies including blockchain,
LLMs, 6G, and semantic communication, as illustrated in
Figure 3. The metaverse, a virtual reality domain that coexists
and intertwines with the physical world, is supported by a
three-layered architecture comprising physical, virtual, and
technical layers. As shown in Figure 4, these layers facilitate
the real-time interaction of users within the confluence of
the physical and virtual realms, opening up new horizons for
human engagement and technological advancements.
1) The Physical Layer: Users, Devices, and Physical
Service Providers. The physical layer encompasses
users, smart wearable devices, and physical service
providers [37]. Users engage with the metaverse’s
virtual domain through intelligent devices such as VR
headsets, HMDs, AR goggles, and human gesture
sensors. These devices capture and transmit sensory
data, bridging the gap between physical and virtual
realities [38]. Smart wearable devices enable users to
upload recorded data and historical behaviors from the
real world onto the metaverse platform, actualizing
the interaction between physical and virtual dimensions. This integration allows users to experience a
seamless transition between realities, fostering deeper
connections with the virtual world [39]. Physical service
providers support the metaverse by delivering essential
technology, including edge network communication,
and computing resource allocation, ensuring seamless
user experiences in the virtual world. These service
providers play a crucial role in maintaining the infrastructure that enables the metaverse to function smoothly
and reliably [40].
2) The Virtual Layer: Immersive Experiences and Digital
Environments. The virtual layer of the metaverse offers
users an immersive virtual world experience, comprising
virtual environments, services, currencies, and avatar
behaviors. By integrating advanced technologies like
high-definition rendering and simulation, the metaverse
develops and maintains expansive virtual spaces that
mimic the complexity and richness of the physical
world [41]. Users can purchase virtual goods, such as
premium videos and clothing, from providers within the
metaverse for enhanced interactive experiences. These
transactions contribute to the growth of a robust virtual
economy, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship
within the digital realm. Furthermore, the virtual layer
can be utilized to construct smart cities, offering valuable insights into urban development and construction.
By simulating urban environments and infrastructure,
city planners and policymakers can explore innovative
solutions, optimize resource allocation, and improve
overall urban living conditions [42].
3) The Technical Layer: A Convergence of CuttingEdge Technologies. The technical layer of the metaverse encompasses various technologies applied to
the virtual realm, including digital twins, blockchain,
network communication, decentralization, computer

vision, cloud computing, mobile edge computing, and
energy conservation [10]. Digital twin technology
enables real-time mapping of physical entities’ composition, characteristics, functions, and performance
within the metaverse. This capability allows for accurate simulations of real-world scenarios, enhancing
decision-making processes and facilitating rapid prototyping [43]. Blockchain, as a distributed shared
database, effectively mitigates issues related to limited
storage resources and privacy breaches. Its decentralized
nature ensures data integrity, security, and transparency,
fostering trust among users and service providers [44].
Network communication technologies are vital for
users’ immersive experiences, virtual offices, and
perceptual communication. High-speed, low-latency
connections enable real-time interactions, creating a
more authentic and engaging virtual environment [45].
Decentralization ensures that no single entity can exert
absolute control over users’ data, promoting a fair and
democratic virtual ecosystem. This fosters innovation
and creativity, empowering individuals and organizations to contribute to the growth of the metaverse [42].
Computer vision, essential for image processing in XR
realization, facilitates interaction between the digital
and physical worlds. This technology enables the more
accurate and efficient rendering of virtual environments, resulting in a more immersive and realistic
user experience. Cloud computing and mobile edge
computing provide the necessary capacity and realtime computing, ensuring the metaverse’s ability to handle large-scale, complex simulations and interactions.
These technologies also contribute to the optimization
of resource utilization and system performance [46].
Energy conservation is crucial for the sustainable, longterm operation of the metaverse. As the metaverse
grows in scale and complexity, the demand for computational power, data storage, and network resources
will increase exponentially. This increased demand
necessitates the implementation of energy-efficient
technologies and strategies to minimize environmental impact and ensure the longevity of the virtual
world [10].
1) BLOCKCHAIN AND METAVERSE-CURRENT SITUATION
The relationship between blockchain technology and the
metaverse is a pivotal one, representing a symbiosis that
enhances the functionality, security, and user experience of
virtual worlds [47]. This connection not only propels the
metaverse towards a decentralized and secure digital ecosystem but also opens new avenues for digital ownership, economy, and identity [48]. We will delve into how blockchain
serves as the backbone for the metaverse, fostering an
environment where digital assets, governance, and identity
thrive on transparency, security, and user empowerment.
Blockchain technology is a decentralized digital ledger that
records transactions across many computers in such a way
that the registered transactions cannot be altered retroactively
[49]. This technology underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin
and Ethereum, providing a secure and transparent way
to conduct transactions without the need for a central
authority [50]. Its implications, however, extend far beyond
financial transactions, offering a foundational layer for the
development of the metaverse [51]. The metaverse refers to a
collective virtual shared space, created by the convergence of
virtually enhanced physical reality, augmented reality (AR),
virtual reality (VR), and the internet [52]. It’s a space where
users can interact with a computer-generated environment
and other users [53]. The metaverse aims to create a space
for rich user interaction mimicking the real world, but within
a digital universe [53]. Blockchain technology introduces the
concept of decentralization to the metaverse, challenging the
traditional centralized models of digital worlds[54]. Through
blockchain, the metaverse becomes a distributed network
managed by its users rather than a single entity [55]. This
decentralization is crucial for digital ownership, allowing
users to truly own their assets in the metaverse [5]. NonFungible Tokens (NFTs), which are unique digital tokens that
signify ownership of digital items on the blockchain, enable
this by representing virtual real estate, artwork, and more
within the metaverse [56]. Blockchain’s inherent security and
transparency features are vital for the metaverse, ensuring
that transactions are secure and immutable [57]. This is
essential in a digital environment where assets and identities
need protection from fraud and theft. The blockchain ledger
provides a transparent and unalterable history of transactions,
enabling trust among users. This transparency is critical
for the digital economy within the metaverse, where users
trade assets and services [52]. Blockchain also plays a
crucial role in managing digital identities and governance
within the metaverse [58]. Through cryptographic keys,
blockchain provides a secure and immutable way to manage
digital identities, allowing users to navigate the metaverse
with verifiable credentials [5]. Moreover, blockchain enables
decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which can
govern the metaverse spaces through collective decisionmaking [59]. This democratizes governance, giving users a
say in the rules and development of the virtual world [60].
The metaverse, powered by blockchain, fosters a new digital
economy where users can create, buy, and sell goods and
services [61]. Cryptocurrencies facilitate transactions within
the metaverse, enabling a seamless transfer of value [57].
This economic model not only provides opportunities for
monetization but also encourages a vibrant ecosystem where
users are incentivized to contribute and participate actively
[62]. While the integration of blockchain into the metaverse
offers numerous benefits, it also presents challenges such
as scalability, interoperability, and user accessibility [63].
Overcoming these challenges is crucial for the widespread
adoption of the metaverse [64]. Future developments in
blockchain technology, such as Layer 2 solutions and crosschain interoperability, are expected to address these issues,
paving the way for a more connected, efficient, and userfriendly metaverse [37], [65]. The relationship between
blockchain technology and the metaverse is fundamentally
transformative, offering a vision of a decentralized, secure,
and user-centric digital universe [15]. This synergy not
only enhances the user experience within virtual worlds but
also lays the groundwork for a new digital economy and
society [35]. As both technologies evolve, their integration
will continue to shape the future of digital interaction,
ownership, and community in the metaverse [57]. The
journey towards a fully realized metaverse is complex and
challenging, yet it promises a future where digital worlds are
as rich and vibrant as the physical world, powered by the
principles of blockchain technology [66].
2) LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMs) AND ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE (AI)
Present situation with Metaverse
a: LLMs
The interaction between LLMs and the metaverse is continuously developing and changing, serving as a crucial
link between sophisticated AI technologies and immersive
virtual spaces [67]. This relationship signals a future in
which AI not only improves the experience of users in
these digital realms but also becomes essential in their
creation, oversight, and ongoing growth [68]. LLMs can
significantly enhance the user experience in the metaverse
through natural language processing (NLP), enabling more
realistic and engaging interactions with virtual entities [69].
These models can generate human-like text responses,
making non-player characters (NPCs) within the metaverse
seem more lifelike [70]. This capability allows for the
creation of complex narratives and dialogues, enriching the
storytelling aspect of virtual worlds [71]. Moreover, LLMs
facilitate language translation in real-time, breaking down
language barriers among users from different parts of the
world [72]. This feature is vital for fostering a truly global
metaverse where users can seamlessly communicate and
collaborate regardless of their native language [9]. LLMs can
also revolutionize content creation within the metaverse by
automating and assisting in the generation of textual content,
such as quests, lore, and dialogue [73]. This automation
can significantly reduce the time and effort required to
populate vast virtual worlds with engaging content, making
the development process more efficient [74]. Furthermore,
LLMs can provide developers with creative suggestions,
plot ideas, speeding up the development of applications and
environments within the metaverse [75]. This collaboration
between human creativity and AI capabilities could lead
to innovative and unprecedented virtual experiences [76].
In the metaverse, governance and moderation are crucial
for maintaining a safe and inclusive environment [77],
[78]. LLMs can assist in moderating content and interactions in real-time, identifying and addressing inappropriate
behavior, hate speech, and other violations of community
guidelines [79], [80]. This application of LLMs ensures a
positive and respectful user experience, essential for the
long-term success and acceptance of the metaverse [81],
[82]. While the integration of LLMs into the metaverse
presents numerous opportunities, it also raises ethical and
technical challenges. Issues such as data privacy, security, and
the potential for generating misleading or harmful content
need to be carefully managed [83], [84], [85]. Developing
transparent, fair, and responsible AI systems is crucial for
their successful application in the metaverse [77], [86].
b: AI
The metaverse, an immersive virtual world, is rapidly evolving with AI enhancing various layers, from infrastructure and
networking to user interaction and content generation. AIdriven solutions, including machine learning (ML) and deep
learning (DL), improve immersion by enabling intelligent
virtual agents and optimizing natural language processing
(NLP), machine vision, and blockchain integration. AI also
enhances networking by ensuring efficient data processing,
security, and real-time communication. It powers avatars,
automates 3D rendering, and optimizes simulations, making
virtual environments more interactive and dynamic [46].
AI significantly improves the cognitive and interaction layer
by enabling real-time, context-aware engagement between
users and digital agents. Using deep learning and NLP,
AI enhances avatars and virtual assistants, making them more
responsive to emotions, intent, and contextual cues. AI-driven
recommendation systems personalize content delivery based
on user behavior, while adaptive interfaces support multimodal interactions, such as voice commands and gestures,
increasing accessibility and engagement [87]. In the network
layer, AI optimizes wireless communication, resource allocation, and connectivity in large-scale virtual environments.
AI-driven radio resource management enhances spectrum
efficiency, traffic prediction, and network slicing for ultrareliable, low-latency communications (uRLLC). Reinforcement learning (RL) dynamically allocates bandwidth, manages power distribution, and predicts network congestion,
improving connectivity in 5G and emerging 6G networks.
Additionally, AI enables intelligent routing, load balancing,
and fault detection, ensuring a stable, high-performance
infrastructure for seamless metaverse experiences[46]. At the
physical layer, AI enhances wireless systems by optimizing
spectrum management, channel prediction, and mobility
forecasting. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long
short-term memory (LSTM) models improve modulation
classification and real-time signal processing, boosting
transmission accuracy and network reliability. AI-driven
cellular traffic forecasting identifies spatial patterns, reducing
latency and enhancing throughput for immersive metaverse
applications [46]. Security and privacy are critical concerns
in the metaverse, and AI plays a key role in protecting
user data and ensuring ethical governance. Blockchainintegrated AI enhances data security through decentralized,
anonymous transactions, while AI-driven encryption and
access controls safeguard sensitive information. AI also
strengthens fraud detection and cybersecurity by identifying
threats and anomalies in real time. Adaptive learning models
address emerging cyber risks, while transparency-focused AI
techniques improve interpretability and human oversight in
security systems [87]. By integrating across these layers,
AI ensures that the metaverse remains efficient, scalable, and
immersive. However, ongoing challenges—such as ethical
considerations, computational efficiency, and data privacy—
must be addressed to achieve a more sustainable and
intelligent metaverse ecosystem.
3) 6G - EDGE LEARNING AND METAVERSE CONTEMPORARY
CONDITION
a: 6G
The research community is currently directing its attention
towards the development of 6G wireless systems, aiming to
address the limitations of current 5G technology, such as
bandwidth and latency constraints, particularly for emerging applications like the metaverse. Various organizations
worldwide, including R&D centers, universities, industries,
and standardization bodies, have outlined their visions for
6G wireless and initiated research efforts accordingly [88].
By 2030, the goal is for 6G to achieve its full potential in
the areas of energy and environmental sustainability, digital
access, and the flexibility of industries such as health and
safety. The main goals of the 6G network are to provide
high data rates, energy efficiency, universal coverage, and
intelligent and reliable connections, thereby paving the way
for the next generation of wireless communications [23].
Firstly, 6G aims to achieve high data rates, with the capability
of reaching up to 1 terabit per second (Tbps). This rate
is significantly higher than current 5G systems, enabling
faster data transfer and supporting emerging use cases that
require high bandwidth. Secondly, it provides high energy
efficiency for limited-resource personal mobile devices. With
the proliferation of mobile devices and the increasing demand
for wireless connectivity, energy efficiency has become a
critical concern. 6G systems aim to address this challenge by
providing energy-efficient solutions supporting the long-term
sustainability of wireless communications [13]. Furthermore,
the next generation aims to establish a universal coverage
network that includes Space, Aerial, Ground, and Undersea
components. This comprehensive network infrastructure will
enable seamless connectivity and uninterrupted services,
regardless of the user’s location or environment. Finally,
6G focuses on providing intelligent and reliable connections
across the entire network. By leveraging advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning
(ML), 6G systems can optimize network performance,
enhance user experience, and ensure reliable connectivity in
various scenarios. From the perspective of service classes,
the evolution is expected to progress from ultra-reliable
low-latency communications (URLLC) and enhanced mobile
broadband (eMBB) to new enhanced services, such as
massive URLLC (mURLLC) [89] and mobile broadband
reliable low latency communication (mBRLLC). The combination of 5G URLLC with existing massive machine-type
communications (mMTC) has given rise to mURLLC,
a service that necessitates a new kind of network framework.
The framework should focus on optimizing reliability,
latency, and scalability, considering the specific needs of
critical applications such as metaverse. The demand for
high reliability and low latency in these critical applications
necessitates the introduction of novel 6G services such
as MBRLLC. This service not only emphasizes energy
efficiency due to its effect on dependability and data rate,
but also acknowledges the limited resources available to 6G
devices [90]. The metaverse, with its immersive multi-user
XR applications, places stringent demands on network Quality of Service (QoS). High-quality XR streams require data
rates exceeding 12 Mbps per user [25], escalating with higher
resolutions and multi-sensory data. Moreover, low latency,
particularly Motion-to-Photon (MTP) latency below 20ms,
is critical for seamless interactions and preventing motion
sickness. While 6G technology, with its theoretical Tbps data
rates and sub-millisecond latency, exhibits the potential to
meet these requirements, real-world implementation must
address challenges like cell density, user distribution, and
energy efficiency to ensure a truly immersive and accessible
metaverse experience for a multitude of users.
b: EDGE LEARNING
Edge learning (EL) is an emerging machine-learning
paradigm that capitalizes on the power of algorithms
deployed on-network edge devices to minimize latency
and bandwidth demands, all while enhancing privacy and
security. With edge learning, real-time data processing and
device adaptation are possible, leading to highly distributed
real-time data generated by edge devices. This can result
in a captivating and immersive metaverse and enhanced
natural language processing algorithms for more intelligent
communication. Furthermore, edge learning can accelerate
the development of 6G technology by facilitating local data
processing and decreasing reliance on centralized processing.
To achieve rapid and cost effective AI training, edge learning
employs innovative techniques such as Federated Learning
(FL), Split Learning (SL), and Multi-Agent Reinforcement
Learning (MARL) [91]. Moreover, it can address core privacy
concerns, bolster security, and improve wireless communications performance. Edge learning is one of several machine
learning paradigms, alongside supervised, unsupervised,
semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning. Among these,
deep learning, which utilizes data-driven feature extraction
and deep neural networks to attain human-level performance
are increasingly being leveraged in wireless communications
and the Internet of Everything (IoE) applications [90]. As the
growth of data processing requirements for deep learning
training has outpaced the development of computing power,
scale-out options are typically a more cost-effective choice
than scale up for machine learning systems [14].
4) SEMANTIC COMMUNICATION - DIGITAL TWIN EXISTING
LINK WITH METAVERSE
a: SEMANTIC COMMUNICATION
Metaverse is the digitalizing of physical space in a visually
and physically interactive way. The physical world interacts
with the digital without physical attendance and that could
be done by using efficient ways of communication in
Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) [92].
VR/AR is not a new technique for digitalizing the physical
world. However, user interaction was limited at the beginning
in specific areas, and by the time the interaction increased
to the point of doing real-time remote surgeries overseas
with the revolution of 5G. the parameters used in such
applications were narrow to appoint of transmitting two
to three parameters such as pressure, Realtime video, and
position. On the other hand, the metaverse enables the
same combination of digitalizing real phenomena. This
combination requires allowing the transfer of big data from
one end to another end and displaying a huge amount of realtime 3D videos allowing the reality of the metaverse [93]
in addition to other parameters. However, with the current
technologies in wireless communication, it is incredibly
challenging to enable all the parameters of metaverse through
the current limited 4G or 5G, and such bandwidth bottleneck
will be an obstacle toward metaverse since it no longer fits the
need. Such an application requires large, synchronized data
carrying different parameters, which causes the approaching
of Shannon limits [94] through wireless. To address such data
transfer limitations in the metaverse, a new communication
technology should replace the one that is more efficient for
VR and AR over wireless data stream.
For instance, metaverse can recreate a digital twin
(DT) for a city in a holistic way by processing different
parameters such as the geo-locations of the buildings and
roads (location), IoT sensors measuring different parameters
(sun brightness, air quality, temperature, etc.) and real-time
camera measuring congestion and road traffic. Such an
application of metaverse helps city planners identify patterns
from the data insights and create a visualized solution to be
evaluated on the DT. That means the metaverse enables the
understating of system relationships and relevant contextual
data, such as the effect of sun brightness on accidents,
or the correlation of temperature with air quality and power
consumption and how it could be improved. However, such
big data needs to be exchanged in real-time and if we can
do so using the sixth generation of wireless communication,
for instance, it is still consuming bandwidth in the context
of savings. Hence, rather than exchange this large amount
of raw data, semantic communication enables a new way of
sending and receiving between endpoints. It utilizes artificial
intelligence models to understand what the sender wants to
send and recreate it on the receiver’s end this way instead of
having a stream of big data exchange between the two ends,
semantic communication exchanges only the knowledge of
the big data. Such a method will also save processing time
and power, resulting in data privacy, power consumption from
transmitting and processing, and bandwidth consumption.
Typically, traditional wireless communication compresses
the data first by source encoding and then by channel encoder
to fulfill the requirement of wireless communication and
transfer a stream of data block, all that is done to achieve an
optimal transmission performance in data transmission [95].
On the other hand, semantic communication uses semantic
encoding not for data compression only. However, it also
extracts the knowledge out of the data block and its semantic
features. This means semantic communication tries to
maximize expected faithfulness in data representation instead
of traditional data streaming over the physical channel [96].
b: DIGITAL TWIN
To provide a unique experience, the metaverse relies
on different feature operations, such as data collecting,
experience transmission manipulation, and generation of
digital components. More importantly, metaverse on other
advanced technologies to replicate it real world such as deep
learning, machine learning, and digital twin. Digital Twin
was first introduced by NASA in the 70s to experiment with
the limit of their shuttles. Today with metaverse, different
digital twins are used to monitor entries and operations
of such an ecosystem [97]. For instance, the DT of the
metaverse service communicates with the digital twin of
the network trying to increase the quality of service and
minimize the cost. The digital twin can be a computerized or
machine model that replicates, simulates, emulates or even
twining the physical entry, which may be an object, data
out of a sensor, human, or human feature interaction [98].
A digital twin holds immense potential for improving the
metaverse by leveraging Artificial intelligence, IoT devices,
and deep learning approaches. These technologies and new
data representations of the physical world revolutionize
the delivery of the metaverse. However, such technology
could be done using different modeling techniques such
as experimental or mathematical. However, mathematical
assumptions take place for modeling such as replacing
non-linear problems with a linear assumption, which may not
reflect the physical twin in the digital twin. In addition, same
as mathematical modeling, experimental modeling suffers
from degradation due to experimental errors due to human
errors. To overcome these issues in the above modeling
techniques, data-driving modeling uses Artificial intelligence
to eliminate errors and wrong assumptions [99].
In addition, a digital twin is considered one of the key
components to enable reality in metaverse technology, where
it is not a single simulator, instead, it combines different
technology parameters from IoT sensors to real-time machine
vision and extended reality to achieve a replicated version of
the real world [Enabling technologies and tools for digital
twin]. Such technology allows direct interaction with the
digital twin (DT) exactly like the physical twin (PT), this
allows experimenting and getting the results from the DT as
accurately as PT [100].
II. METAVERSE APPLICATIONS
The metaverse represents a virtual universe where people
can interact with one another and their surroundings through
digital avatars. It offers a plethora of potential applications,
as illustrated in Figure 5, including entertainment, gaming,
immersive education, smart cities, medical training, industrial
simulations, and digital tourism. In this section, we will
discuss each metaverse applications and tie them with their
related technologies.
A. METAVERSE CORE APPLICATIONS
Core metaverse applications provide the fundamental structure and sustainability of the metaverse. In this section,
we will discuss and explore metaverse core applications,
examining their roles and related technologies.
1) IMMERSIVE EDUCATION
Immersive learning refers to activities for learning that are
mediated or medially enhanced setting that creates a feeling
of presence [101]. The intersection of 6G networks and
LLMs is crucial to create immersive education in the Metaverse with both computational power and ultra-low latency
to provide real-time interactive learning. LLMs enable
hyper-personalized learning through the examination of user
preference, tailored content creation, and natural language
interface in virtual classrooms. In the meantime, 6G networks
deliver high-bandwidth, reliable connectivity for the seamless
synchronization of volumetric video, AI-driven simulations,
and haptic feedback—essential components of immersive
learning environments. The integration of these technologies
creates a scalable, intelligent, and highly interactive learning
space that adapts in real time to each individual learner,
with low latency and high throughput for optimizing live
engagement and learning outcomes [102]. Edge learning and
semantic communication facilitate immersive education in
the Metaverse immensely. Both enable real-time, contextaware, and adaptive learning. Pervasive semantic Metaverse
uses edge learning for the analysis and processing of data
closer to the user. It reduces latency and bandwidth usage and
helps provide personalized and efficient content delivery for
AR/VR-based learning. Semantic communication enhances
the delivery of information by communicating just the most
critical meanings instead of raw data, and hence enables
communication to work at its best within immersive learning spaces. This integration offers intelligent and reactive
education systems that can change content, interaction,
and simulation depending on what the learners need, and
thereby provide seamless and interactive virtual learning
experiences [16].
2) REMOTE WORK
The term remote work refers to a flexible work arrangement
in which employees operate in locations that are not close
to their central offices or production facilities, but they may
still connect with their coworkers via technology [103]. The
integration of 6G networks and LLMs is at the core of the
advancement of remote work in the Metaverse through the
delivery of intelligent, low-latency, and adaptive virtual workplaces. 6G technology, with its ultra-reliable low-latency
communication (URLLC) and high data rate, offers end-toend seamless connectivity and real-time communication in
remote work settings, supporting applications such as virtual
meetings, remote collaboration, and AI-driven automation.
Concurrently, LLMs enhance user engagement through realtime assistance, intelligent content generation, and contextdependent communication, thus making virtual offices more
efficient and user-friendly. The combination of these technologies allows for dynamic and intelligent decision-making
because LLMs process and synthesize vast amounts of data
in real-time while 6G ensures that these insights are provided
with minimal latency. This synergy redefines remote work
in the Metaverse by producing immersive, interactive, and
AI-driven workspaces that adapt to users’ needs in real-time
[104]. Edge learning and semantic communication are very
important to augment remote work in the Metaverse. They
render data processing more effective, remove delays, and
ensure effective communication. Edge learning processes and
analyzes data in real-time at the point of origin, reducing the
necessity to send huge amounts of raw data to central servers.
This is especially useful in remote work environments,
where fast response and efficient bandwidth usage are
extremely important. Semantic communication achieves this
by only sending necessary data, as opposed to redundant or
useless information, so that communication can be efficient
even under bandwidth constraints. With these technologies,
remote working in the Metaverse is more convenient, more
interactive, and better tailored to what users need. It supports
intelligent virtual collaboration and rapid decision-making,
while minimizing network traffic and saving energy [105].
3) SMART CITIES
Smart cities are metropolitan regions that make use of
cutting-edge technologies and digital tools to update government services, improve accessibility, boost economic growth,
and enhance sustainability [106]. Smart cities leverage 6G
networks to enhance urban connectivity, enabling real-time
data transmission, ultra-low latency communication, and
integration of physical and digital infrastructure. 6G’s
advanced features, including AI-driven network optimization
and intelligent resource allocation, support critical smart
city applications such as autonomous transport, energyefficient infrastructure, and emergency response systems.
Meanwhile, edge learning plays a vital role in smart cities
by moving data processing closer to the source to reduce
latency and bandwidth usage and enable real-time decisionmaking. Through the integration of edge computing, smart
cities can optimize resource management, enhance urban
mobility, and enhance public services through localized AIpowered analysis. The convergence of 6G and edge learning
yields a highly adaptive and reactive smart city environment,
where intelligent systems can dynamically react to the
needs of the city while delivering efficient and sustainable
operations [107]. The MetaOmniCity framework integrates
digital twins (DTs) within smart cities to develop immersive
urban Metaverse cyberspaces that serve urban planning,
management, and citizen engagement. Digital twins are
virtual replicas of physical cities with high fidelity, which
can simulate and monitor cities in real-time. With this
integration, smart cities leverage digital twins to build virtual
copies that mimic real-world dynamics, enabling data-driven
decision-making and predictive analytics. The Metaverse
expands on this concept with interactive and immersive
experiences where citizens can engage with city spaces within
a virtual environment, participate in governance, and receive
city services remotely. The fusion of digital twins with
the Metaverse makes smart cities active, intelligent systems
that enhance urban living through enhanced infrastructure
management, resource optimization, and enriched social
engagement [108].
4) PRODUCT TESTING
Metaverse product testing is an interactive digital test in a
virtual environment using XR technologies and AI to test
user data and optimize designs before production. It uses
virtual spaces, sensors, and market simulations to ensure
products meet user demands [109].The 6G-driven Metaverse revolutionizes product testing by enabling real-time
simulation in virtual worlds, reducing physical prototypes
to a minimum. 6G’s ultra-low latency and high-bandwidth
allow for frictionless interaction between digital twins and
AI-powered testing models, with increased accuracy and
efficiency. Parallel testing across both physical and virtual
worlds becomes feasible through the integration, optimizing
design iterations and accelerating product development.
This yields cost-effective and scalable testing solutions in
immersive Metaverse worlds[10]. The Metaverse, enabled by
edge learning, transforms product testing through real-time
simulation and intelligent data processing at the network
FIGURE 5. Ubiquitous metaverse applications.
edge. Edge AI optimizes testing efficiency through local
data processing and analysis, reducing latency and bandwidth
use. Edge learning results in this merging capability for
industries to conduct simultaneous virtual and physical
testing, improving product validation and innovation. As a
result, edge learning enhances the accuracy, scalability,
and cost-effectiveness of Metaverse-based product testing
[10]. The integration of digital twins and the Metaverse
enhances product testing through virtual simulation of consumer electronics before actual manufacturing. Digital twins
construct real-time, data-driven product representations,
allowing manufacturers to optimize designs and monitor
performance. In the Metaverse, these virtual models establish
interactive test environments where users and engineers can
test functionality and durability. This integration reduces
costs, enhances product reliability, and accelerates innovation
in consumer electronics [110].
5) PRODUCTION OPTIMIZATION
Metaverse product optimization is an iterative, AI-driven,
user-involved process that enhances product design, usability,
and market relevance continuously. It utilizes virtual worlds,
real-time user interaction, and automated data processing
to refine products before physical production, making them
align with evolving user specifications and industry standards
[109]. 6G plays a key role in streamlining production in
the Metaverse through the provision of ultra-low latency
communication and high data rate transmission for real-time
automation and monitoring. Its advanced connectivity allows
for seamless integration between physical production processes and virtual simulations, enhancing efficiency and
precision. With massive machine-type communication and
smart network management, 6G ensures adaptive production
processes and optimized resource allocation. 6G enables
a more responsive, data-driven manufacturing process that
enhances productivity and scalability [11]. Edge learning
streamlines production in the Metaverse by processing
data and making intelligent decisions in real time at the
edge of the network. This reduces latency and streamlines
industrial processes’ efficiency, allowing adaptive process
control. The Metaverse integrates digital twins and edge
computing to simulate and streamline production processes
dynamically. This combination ensures improved resource
allocation, reduced downtime, and improved manufacturing
accuracy [111]. Digital twins are central to production
optimization in the Metaverse through the development
of real-time virtual replicas of manufacturing processes.
These models facilitate predictive analysis, improving efficiency and reducing operational costs through data-driven
decision-making. In the Metaverse, digital twins facilitate
immersive simulations, improving remote monitoring and
control of industrial processes. This integration optimizes
resource utilization and accelerates innovation in smart
manufacturing [112].
6) GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT
Gaming is one of the strongest drivers of the metaverse,
enabling immersive experiences with VR, AR, and game
engines. Avatars enable social interaction, and platforms such
as Fortnite are turned into metaverse hubs [113]. The use
of blockchain in the metaverse is transforming the gaming
industry by creating new ways of digital ownership, economic
prospects, and social interaction. Blockchain-enabled nonfungible tokens (NFTs) enable gamers to create provable
ownership of virtual assets, which can be exchanged,
personalized, and commercialized in virtual economies. This
transformation allows players to be part of a decentralized
gaming system where virtual assets are genuinely valuable,
healthy gaming communities and incentivizing innovative
play. Blockchain also offers game mechanics that are
transparent, blocking fraud and encouraging trust among
developers and players. However, with the advent of virtual
asset markets is the potential for speculation, access, and even
inequality as premium virtual real estate becomes unrealistically expensive. As blockchain gaming keeps expanding, its
developers must surmount these challenges while leveraging
its benefits to create an open and innovative gaming
platform [113]. The metaverse and large language models
are revolutionizing gaming and entertainment with enhanced
user experience, interactivity, and immersion. In autonomous
racing game, the metaverse introduces dynamic virtual
worlds that simulate real-world challenges, races become
more engaging and unpredictable. Large language models
enhance this experience by generating real-time personalized
commentary for races, providing segment-specific insights to
different parts of the audience depending on their expertise
and interests. This fusion not only increases spectator interest
but also serves as an educational experience, with participants
and viewers able to learn about advanced race strategies
and autonomous car technologies. By combining interactive
AI-driven commentary with metaverse-based virtual simulations, gaming and entertainment providers can create
more interactive, inclusive, and immersive digital experiences
[114]. The integration of gaming, the metaverse, and edge
learning is increasingly recognized as a critical advancement in digital environments. Edge-enabled technologies
play a fundamental role in facilitating the development
of the metaverse by addressing the computational and
networking challenges associated with rendering immersive
three-dimensional virtual environments. Furthermore, edge
learning enhances the functionality of AI-driven avatars,
improves the realism of gaming experiences, and optimizes
real-time user interactions within virtual spaces. In addition,
the incorporation of blockchain technologies and decentralized management of resources improves the sustainability,
security, and interoperability of gaming ecosystems within
the metaverse [37].
7) DIGITAL MARKETING
The growth of virtual markets and digital assets within the
metaverse has revolutionized economic activity by creating
a thriving ecosystem in which users can own, trade, and
monetize virtual goods. Metaverse environments such as
Second Life, Decentraland, and Sandbox are powered by
blockchain-based assets and user-generated content (UGC),
enabling users to create, sell, and trade digital assets,
including virtual land and NFTs. As opposed to conventional
markets, digital assets within the metaverse are valuable
because of usefulness, scarcity, and programmability, with
certain platforms implementing artificial scarcity to promote exclusivity and stability in the market. With the
incorporation of blockchain technology, there is transparent
ownership and secure transactions, which makes such virtual
marketplaces even more decentralized and less vulnerable
to fraud. Besides, metaverse currencies such as Linden
Dollars, MANA, and SAND enable frictionless economic
transactions, with some platforms allowing real-world value
exchange. With the expansion of the metaverse economy,
demand for digital assets continues, attracting investments
and reshaping traditional market structures [115]. The
transformation of market dynamics through user engagement and digital entrepreneurship in the metaverse is
remaking economic structures by encouraging decentralized
involvement and innovation. Users are not just passive
consumers but also active contributors, creating and trading
digital goods, virtual services, and NFTs within autonomous
economies. The elimination of traditional market barriers
enables small-scale digital entrepreneurs to enter the market,
reducing dependence on large corporations and centralized
financial institutions. Apart from that, blockchain and
DeFi-supported virtual marketplaces ensure safe property
rights and transactions, allowing users to monetize skills
and assets more on their own. As metaverse economies gain
increasing attention, there is greater demand for virtual labor,
digital imagination, and peer-to-peer exchange, altering the
basic nature of traditional market forms and promoting a more
democratized, user-driven economy [116].
8) DIGITAL OWNERSHIP
By digital ownership, we mean that users are permitted
to access and/or use data, information and knowledge
about themselves or about the objects belonging to them.
They can also grant or revoke rights on these data [117].
Blockchain is the foundation of digital ownership in the
metaverse through secure, verifiable, and decentralized asset
management. By its tamper-proof ledger and cryptographybased security, blockchain ensures that digital assets—virtual
real estate, NFTs, and in-game items—are assured proven
ownership and scarcity. Smart contracts also consolidate
this system through automated transactions and enforcement
of ownership rights with no intermediaries required. This
decentralized framework reduces risks of fraud, unauthorized
copying, and reliance on central authorities, and allows for
a trustless system where users can freely engage in digital
commerce without hesitation. Furthermore, interoperability
on blockchain allows for seamless transfer of assets from
one metaverse to another, towards one large digital economy
[5]. Blockchain offers trust, security, and interoperability in
the metaverse in the form of an auditable and transparent
digital asset management system. Blockchain with the help
of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) enables users to exchange
digital goods safely without forfeiting their property rights.
Traditional NFT protocols necessarily reveal owner information, which is a concern for privacy. In addressing this, more
advanced cryptographic solutions such as zero-knowledge
proofs (ZKPs) and cryptographic commitments have been
proposed to facilitate privacy-preserved transactions that are
publicly verifiable. These systems allow for users to participate in social and economic activity safely without revealing
their identity. Blockchain also facilitates cross-platform
interoperability across different metaverse environments by
using standardized protocols such as Ethereum’s ERC-721,
which provides seamless asset transfer and cross-platform
compatibility [118]. Monetization within the metaverse is
driven by emerging economic models that blend virtual
assets, digital currencies, and decentralized transactions.
Businesses and individuals engage in a digital economy
in which virtual land, user-generated content (UGC), and
tokenized assets drive revenue streams. The metaverse
creator economy enables users to monetize content through
blockchain-based marketplaces that ensure authenticity and
ownership via NFTs. Additionally, new industries such as
virtual tourism and online events contribute to an expanding
economic landscape. Nevertheless, regulatory complexities
and financial uncertainty remain key determinants for
sustainable growth [119].
9) EDUCATION AND TRAINING
Training and education in the metaverse are being transformed through the integration of Large Language Models
(LLMs), enabling intelligent and adaptive learning environments. Within metaverse-based classrooms, AI-powered
digital twin teachers facilitate real-time training and interactive education, providing students with instant feedback,
contextual explanations, and personalized tutoring. These
virtual instructors enhance skill development and knowledge
acquisition by dynamically adjusting their responses based
on individual learning progress. Moreover, LLM-driven
training modules allow for self-paced learning, handson simulations, and interactive problem-solving, making
educational experiences more engaging and effective. For
educators, AI-powered assistants help streamline student
inquiries, automate repetitive tasks, and focus on complex
problem-solving, thereby optimizing the training process.
By merging LLMs with metaverse environments, education
and training become scalable, personalized, and continuously
evolving, creating a transformative digital learning ecosystem
[120]. Metaverse training and education are being transformed through the integration of 6G technology, which
provides low-latency, high-speed communication and realtime AI-based learning experience. The report highlights how
6G enhances metaverse-based training with ultra-reliable
connectivity, edge computing, and AI foundation models to
support real-time feedback, adaptive simulations, and skill
acquisition by machines. With intelligent automation and
federated learning, learning platforms can offer adaptive
training programs that adapt according to the progress of the
user for more scalable and efficient learning. Additionally,
AI models powered by 6G facilitate seamless interaction
and collaboration and hence make virtual classes and onthe-job training more effective. With the convergence of 6G
technology and AI-based content generation, training and
learning in the metaverse become more dynamic, intelligent,
and adaptive to the needs of students, reshaping the future of
online education [121]. Education and training in the metaverse are significantly enhanced through the integration of
Edge Learning and Digital Twin technologies, which enable
real-time, data-driven, and adaptive learning experiences.
Digital Twins replicate physical environments, learners, and
training scenarios within the metaverse, allowing for precise
and immersive simulations. Meanwhile, Edge Learning
ensures that AI-driven computations and learning models
operate efficiently at the network edge, reducing latency and
enabling faster feedback, personalized learning paths, and
real-time assessment of learner performance. The document
highlights how these technologies support metaverse-based
education by optimizing resource allocation, improving
real-time decision-making, and enhancing adaptive training
environments. By leveraging Edge Learning for intelligent
data processing and Digital Twins for accurate virtual
replications, the metaverse creates a scalable, efficient, and
highly interactive ecosystem for education and training [122].
B. METAVERSE ENABLING APPLICATIONS
Metaverse-enabling applications are tools and technologies
that increase functionality, accessibility, and user experience
in the metaverse. These applications enable core metaverse
elements through offering sophisticated methods of interaction, enhanced communication, and increased immersion.
1) ENHANCED COMMUNICATION
Large Language Models (LLMs) are an important part of
6G network evolution, facilitating better communication and
allowing the metaverse to expand seamlessly. LLMs improve
the intelligence of networks by streamlining performance,
fault detection automation, and providing real-time decisionmaking, all of which are essential to cater to 6G’s highspeed and low-latency requirements. Their ability to process
and generate multimodal data—text, images, and video—
enables dynamic adaptation of networks, predictive analysis,
and intelligent management of resources, so that metaverse
experiences are never disrupted and completely immersive.
6G networks, through the incorporation of LLM-based
optimizations, can provide real-time, AI-driven interactions,
enabling the scalability, personalization, and security of
the metaverse to be enhanced. LLMs are ultimately the
foundation for a self-sustaining, intelligent communications
infrastructure underlying the next-gen digital ecosystem
[123]. Edge learning plays a major role in enhancing
communication in the metaverse using smart, low-latency,
and adaptive network control. With the application of
mobile edge computing (MEC), edge learning optimizes task
offloading, caching policy, and real-time data processing,
significantly reducing communication delay. This allows
metaverse applications such as digital twins and AR/VR
environments to be run seamlessly with little latency and
high reliability. Moreover, edge intelligence enhances ultrareliable low-latency communication (URLLC) in the form of
dynamic resource allotment, proactively predicting congestion, and online bandwidth adjustments. These capabilities
are essential to deliver immersive metaverse experiences
where unbroken, high-fidelity interaction relies on reliable,
adaptive communicative platforms. Lastly, edge learning
transforms communication in the metaverse by making it
faster, more efficient and responsive, bridging the virtual vs.
real communication gap [124]. Semantic communication is
an innovative function for more efficient communication in
the metaverse that enables smarter, more significant, and
more powerful digital interaction. Unlike data exchange by
traditional channels, Semantic communication is committed
to exchanging context and purpose, thereby making communication within virtual contexts not only accurate but also
responsive and intuitive. In the metaverse, where experience
is dependent on real-time responsiveness and user interaction,
Semantic communication maximizes data transmission by
putting meaning ahead of redundancy, with a substantial
reduction in bandwidth usage and increased relevance of content. The incorporation of AI-based Semantic communication
models also enhances user interaction, allowing natural
language understanding, personalized feedback, and cultural
adaptability. This new communication infrastructure renders
virtual and augmented reality interactions more organic, giving way to a seamless integrated digital space where users are
able to interact, collaborate, and engage without the encumbrance of traditional communication bottlenecks [125].
2) DECENTRALIZED FINANCE (DeFi)
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) constitutes the metaverse’s
financial framework, ensuring transparent, secure, and
intermediary-free financial transactions across virtual
economies. Through blockchain-secured smart contracts,
DeFi offers lending, borrowing, staking, and yield farming
that allows users to generate income within the metaverse.
The merger of DeFi with the metaverse enhances accessibility
to financial products, particularly among individuals in
remote locations where banks are inaccessible. Also,
decentralized exchanges (DEXs) facilitate seamless trading
of assets, and tokenized assets like NFTs and virtual land
facilitate investment and monetization. As the metaverse
continues to mature, DeFi continues to drive economic innovation, promoting decentralized governance and financial
inclusion [51]. Metaverse economic empowerment is driven
by tokenized ownership using blockchain and DeFi, enabling
users to engage in decentralized economics. People have
direct control over virtual properties, gaming assets, and
intellectual property using NFTs and digital assets without
intermediaries in a centralized fashion. DeFi protocols also
enhance finance access even more by providing lending,
borrowing, and staking services in the metaverse whereby
users can lever digital assets for monetization as collateral.
Decentralized governance frameworks such as DAOs also
allow users to participate in decision-making on virtual
economies, enabling a more level and community-driven
financial environment [126].
3) IDENTITY AND AUTHENTICATION
Metaverse decentralized identity, enabled by blockchain
technology, ensures safe and user-controlled access by not
relying on centralized servers for identification. Traditional
authentication mechanisms require users to provide personal
identifiers such as passwords and biometrics to particular
platform servers, thus raising privacy concerns and security
vulnerabilities. Decentralized identity (DID) blockchainbased platforms allow users to authenticate themselves on
the basis of self-sovereign identity (SSI) principles, with
identity credentials stored on a blockchain rather than
being controlled by centralized entities. The integration of
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and biometric authentication provides an additional layer of security, enabling
users to manage their digital identities openly without
identity fraud and misuse. This approach establishes trust
in the metaverse through ensuring that users own and
have control over their digital avatars across different
virtual worlds [127]. Authenticity for antifraud and trust
in the metaverse is facilitated by a secure, decentralized
environment for guaranteeing traceability of avatars to their
owners in the real world. Traditional authentication methods
such as password-based authentication remain vulnerable
to impersonation and identity fraud. To overcome such
threats, a biometric-based model of authentication combining
chameleon signature algorithms enhances security through
the association of an avatar’s virtual identity with its physical
identity. This system applies two-factor authentication, using
biometric data and cryptographic keys, to ensure that only
the genuine owners can access their metaverse identity.
Decentralized authentication protocols further ensure that
no central authorities can manipulate identities, uphold
user privacy, and verify authenticity. Through real-time
authentication of avatar identities, this system eliminates
fake activities and unauthorized use, making it a safer
and more secure virtual world [128]. Interoperable identity
across various metaverse platforms is essential to efficient
user authentication and virtual security. Meta-ID framework,
which relies on blockchain, offers a mechanism through
which users can maintain one consistent identity across
diverse metaverse environments. The decentralized nature
of this method eliminates redundant registration and other
types of authentication mechanisms, thereby the avoidance
of security threats like impersonation, replay attacks, and
server spoofing. Using Hyperledger Fabric, the system
maintains identity credentials securely saved and secured on
a blockchain, enabling trust and transparency. The Metaverse
Interoperable Identity Framework (MIF) also provides a
standard identification mechanism that maps physical-user
identities to virtual avatars, therefore a standardized authentication process for all platforms. It improves security
because it advances user experience by facilitating seamless
movement among metaverse spaces without compromising
identity integrity [129].
4) GOVERNANCE
Decentralized decision-making in the metaverse through
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) allows
users to participate in decision-making independent of centralized entities. The Meta-Governance system, as proposed
in the paper, uses blockchain and AI to build an open,
secure, and user-focused system of governance. This ensures
that norms of behavior are enforced impartially using smart
contracts to automate enforcement of rules and prevent
manipulation. By recording governance decisions on an
immutable ledger, blockchain enhances accountability and
trust within virtual environments. The system also has behavior monitoring and credit scoring mechanisms, where users
are held responsible for actions such as hate speech, cyberbullying, and misinformation. This approach reduces the
risk of monopolistic control, promotes community engagement, and creates a stronger, equitable, and self-regulating
metaverse ecosystem [130]. Blockchain provides enforceable
and transparent governance rules in the metaverse by
avoiding centralization risks and making people accountable.
Centralized metaverse platforms are usually plagued by
monopolistic control, capricious alteration of rules, and lack
of transparency, resulting in metaverse governance instability.
Blockchain-based governance possesses an immutable ledger
for recording decisions, ensuring that governance activities
are transparent, verifiable, and tamper-proof. Smart contracts
make automated policy enforcement possible, while bypassing unilateral interventions and supporting decentralized
decision-making. Disbalances in token-based voting and
potential wealth centralization may continue to influence the
fairness of governance mechanisms. Blockchain enhances the
metaverse’s ability to create a fair and responsible governance
model by integrating open standards and on-chain governance mechanisms [60]. Blockchain enables cross-metaverse
governance and legal adherence by establishing a trusted collaborative system of governance that maintains transparency,
responsibility, and security on virtual platforms. As metaverse environments expand beyond isolated ecosystems,
governance fragmentation becomes an issue, necessitating a
standard framework for regulatory application. Blockchain
governance enables multi-party agreement processes to
ensure governance decisions, data exchanges, and user
interactions adhere to defined policies. Smart contracts
play a crucial role in automating checks for compliance,
reducing the need for centralized action while maintaining
regulatory integrity. Further, blockchain-supported identity
verification and data traceability ensure that users and
digital assets comply with the law and ethical requirements
across diverse metaverse systems. Through the inclusion of
a value-driven model of governance, blockchain supports
cooperation and regulatory conformity, allowing smoothly
operating interconnected metaverse ecosystems [131].
5) INTEROPERABILITY
Interoperability in the metaverse allows for end-users and
digital assets to have automatic interaction across different
virtual worlds while ensuring homogeneity in asset functionality and identity management. Blockchain provides the
basis for cross-platform asset and identity interoperability by
removing silos that impede the portability of digital assets
such as avatars, NFTs, and in-game money. This challenge
is met by blockchain solutions such as MetaOpera by
developing a standardized interoperability protocol, by which
users move their assets securely between decentralized and
centralized metaverse platforms. Blockchain achieves this
by integrating cross-chain technologies and on-chain and
off-chain mechanisms, providing digital assets with the
maintenance of value and functionality in several metaverses. Furthermore, decentralized identity (DID) protocols
allow users to authenticate on platforms without multiple
registrations, boosting security and user experience. This
blockchain-based process creates a more integrated, trustable,
and scalable metaverse ecosystem [63]. Cross-chain bridges
and smart contracts play a crucial role in enabling efficient digital transactions between different platforms on
the metaverse. Smart contracts are automated contracts
that execute transactions automatically, guaranteeing secure
and efficient exchanges of data without going through
intermediaries. They make various digital services possible,
ranging from virtual asset trading to financial transactions
and decentralized applications. Cross-chain bridges offer
even more integration by allowing assets and information
to be moved from one network to another, making more
freedom and access possible throughout digital worlds.
Bridges allow different systems to become more integrated
so users can exchange digital currencies, virtual assets, and
other commodities with ease. However, although they boost
liquidity and access, cross-chain bridges also need to combat
security threats such as unauthorized access and system
weaknesses in order to guarantee trustworthy transactions
in the metaverse [132]. Standardization and governance
are required to create a unified metaverse economy so
that companies and users can seamlessly interact between
different virtual worlds. Blockchain interoperability plays
a crucial role in addressing the issue of fragmentation
in the metaverse ecosystem, wherein individual platforms
lead to user lock-in and monopoly control. Decentralized
governance systems and open standards provide secure
transfer of digital assets, like non-fungible tokens and
cryptocurrencies, in a regulatory structure-compliant fashion.
Multi-metaverse ecosystems rooted in blockchain technology
can also advance economic equality by reducing access
barriers and encapsulating the power of large companies in
virtual economies. By bringing governance frameworks in
line with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals,
blockchain-enabled interoperability fosters a more transparent, inclusive and sustainable metaverse that benefits
individuals, businesses, and society as a whole [133].
6) DYNAMIC CONTENT GENERATION
Dynamic content generation is the primary catalyst of an
adaptive and interactive metaverse that enables virtual spaces
to change dynamically in real time based on users’ interactions. Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), metaverse
platforms are capable of dynamically generating and modifying avatars, objects, spaces, and interactive behavior without
the use of scripts or programming by hand. This provides the
user with the capability of authoring experiences dynamically
via natural language directives, so that the metaverse can
become immersive and reactive. Compared to static content,
dynamic content generation promises ongoing innovation,
with virtual spaces constantly changing in line with user taste,
behavior, and context. With AI-powered content generation,
the metaverse is a unified digital universe, fueling endless
creativity and engagement [134]. Real-time interaction and
immersive storytelling are central to providing interactive and
dynamic metaverse experiences, where AI-generated content
enables the interaction of intelligent agents and developing
storylines with users. The article discusses how AI-based
scene content generation enables interactive storytelling
through the dynamic generation of metaverse scenes in
response to user input. Unlike traditional pre-authored
narratives, AI-based systems support adaptive and emergent
storytelling, where intelligent agents modify their behavior
and dialogue in real time based on user activity. This supports
immersion with personalized and context-aware virtual
experiences, making storytelling interactive and immersive.
Through the use of deep learning and procedural content
generation, the metaverse can provide an uninterrupted and
evolving storytelling experience, and digital stories become
interactive, responsive, and ever-evolving [135]. Content
generation is the key to the scalability and automation
of virtual world creation, enabling metaverse platforms to
scale dynamically without needing huge amounts of human
development. Using AI-powered procedural generation and
large language models (LLMs), virtual worlds can be built,
modified, and customized in real-time, reducing the need
for human designers. AI systems can create interactive environments, scenery, stories, and user-directed experiences so
that metaverse worlds are dynamic and constantly changing.
Moreover, context-aware AI agents can aid users in getting
started and discovery, dynamically modifying the virtual
environment in light of user behavior. This automation,
besides increasing efficiency and scalability, can also lead to
more personalization and diversity in metaverse experiences
and thus render virtual environments more engaging and useraware [136].
7) PERSONALIZED EXPERIENCES
Personalized experiences in the metaverse are driven by
LLMs, which modify interactions based on the specific
behavior, tastes, and history of individual users. Through
processing real-time context and long-term discovery history,
LLMs generate personalized output that renders online
interactions intuitive and enjoyable. LLMs enable users
navigating open-world environments efficiently, with personalized recommendations, recalling actions, and dynamically
modifying conversation. This individualization heightens
engagement, ensuring that each user’s experience is uniquely
customized to their interests and past selections. However,
hazards such as context misinterpretation and cascading
misinformation must be addressed in a manner that maintains
the experience continuous and personalized with accuracy
and consistency. [136]. The Metaverse as an Immersive Space
for Personalized Experience is essentially characterized by
the integration of XR technologies and LLMs, creating
highly adaptive and interactive environments. XR, which
includes VR, AR, and MR, enables users to interact with
deeply immersive virtual worlds. LLMs boost engagement
within these settings through their functioning as virtual
characters or interactive narratives, providing dynamic and
personalized interaction. Through the leveraging of speechto-text, text-to-speech, and multimodal AI capabilities, LLMs
facilitate human-like and contextually sensitive discourse,
creating more natural and instinctual user interfaces. Such
AI features create heightened immersion by responding to
users in real time, making more interactive experiences
possible with adaptive storytelling, individualized support,
and socially conscious NPCs. However, privacy risks and
ethical issues are at stake, particularly because XR spaces
record biometric sensor data, including eye-tracking and
motion tracking, that can be combined with LLM-driven
interactions. Despite these concerns, the use of LLMs in
XR spaces presents a groundbreaking opportunity to create
highly inclusive, interactive, and adaptive digital experiences
[67]. The creation of highly personalized digital experiences
is made possible through the integration of LLMs and the
metaverse, allowing virtual worlds to adapt dynamically to
suit individual users. LLMs respond in harmony with personal preference, medical history, and usage patterns through
the examination of real-time behavior data, past interactions,
and contextual data. This capability has deep implications
in medical applications, with AI-powered assistants providing patients with personalized treatment recommendations,
virtual consultations, and adaptive educational content in
interactive metaverse spaces. Patients are given personalized
digital treatments that ensure interventions addressing their
unique requirements and supporting long-term engagement
and self-management. Additionally, avatars and NPCs (nonplayer characters) based on LLM enable unbroken, adaptive
dialogue, responding wisely to user queries and guiding
users through interactive virtual experiences. But realizing
true personalization means overcoming privacy issues, bias
problems, and regulatory hurdles to ensuring that metaverse
interactions enabled by AI are accurate, secure, and ethically
applied [137].
8) ACCESSIBILITY
The accessibility challenges of virtual and digital environments are rooted in design limitations, barriers created by
technology, and the absence of standard frameworks that
adopt inclusivity. Most VR and AR applications are designed
primarily for non-disabled individuals, with a tendency to
overlook individuals with visual, auditory, cognitive, or motor
disabilities. Visually impaired players experience difficulty
with interface readability and object recognition, whereas
person with hearing impairment or hard-of-hearing players
have problems with in-game auditory cues and virtual speech.
Similarly, players with mobility impairments often encounter
difficulties with motion controls, haptic feedback, and
navigation of controllers. Cognitive accessibility is a concern
as well since neurodivergent players might be overpowered
by fast-paced, sensory-dense environments. In addition, the
absence of consistent accessibility standards in immersive
technologies leads to varied implementations of assistive
features, such as screen readers, voice command, and
alternative navigation methods. To ensure equitable access
to the future metaverse, it is critical to take proactive steps
involving universal design, regulatory compliance, and the
development of flexible user experiences, thus making digital
spaces more inclusive and immersive for all users [138]. The
metaverse provides the transformative opportunity to create
accessible virtual environments that enhance accessibility
and inclusion for diverse categories of users. Through the
integration of XR technologies, including VR, AR, and
MR, virtual environments can be made more interactive
and personalized to accommodate individuals with varying
abilities and requirements. AI-powered avatars and virtual
agents with LLMs have the potential to facilitate real-time
interaction, paving the way towards more accessible interaction for users with disabilities. Also, multimodal AI-powered
interfaces like speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and customized
user interfaces offer useful tools for individuals with visual,
auditory, or cognitive disabilities, thus enabling increased
participation in virtual environments. Nevertheless, despite
the metaverse creating a more immersive and inclusive digital
environment, concerns like high cost, accessibility of devices,
and inequality in digital literacy need to be resolved to
promote equal access for all [67]. LLMs are instrumental in
making virtual and digital spaces, including the Metaverse,
more accessible. Through the utilization of NLP and
AI powered interfaces, LLMs facilitate easier interaction
for individuals with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive
disabilities in immersive spaces. Speech-to-text and text-tospeech functionality allow for communication by the hearing
and speech impaired, and chatbots and virtual assistants
powered by AI navigate users through digital environments
with personalized, context-dependent assistance. LLMs can
additionally offer real-time translation, summarize complex
information, and adjust content delivery to meet differing
cognitive needs to improve inclusive digital engagement.
Yet, the incorporation of LLMs within accessibility systems
presents other challenges, including bias in AI models, the
requirement for stringent data privacy, and ensuring accuracy
and reliability of AI-generated content. As the Metaverse
is developed, the integration of LLM-based accessibility
functions in XR ecosystems will be key to creating fully
inclusive, adaptable, and user-focused virtual spaces [139].
9) HOLOGRAPHIC DESIGN
Holographic design is the foundation for interactive digital
experiences through the application of advanced light field
technology and real-time 3D rendering to create realistic projections. Unlike traditional 2D displays, holographic systems
deliver spatial awareness, depth perception, and natural interactivity, which enable users to engage with digital content
in a way that mimics real-world interactions. These systems
are crucial to the metaverse, which they enhance in user
immersion through smooth virtual and physical integration,
enabling applications in education, entertainment, healthcare,
and commerce. Computer-generated holography advances
further enable greater accessibility and personalization,
enabling the generation of highly interactive virtual worlds
that learn and adapt to user behavior and context requirements. However, problems of high computational expense,
bandwidth constraint, and visual fatigue must be addressed
in order to ensure the scalability and usability of holographic
interfaces in digital environments [140]. The metaverse
is a space where holographic integration offers real-time,
immersive interactions between digital and physical realms.
Through the use of AR and VR technologies, the ubiquitous
semantic Metaverse offers an active, networked virtual world
where holographic projections and spatial computing enrich
user experience. This integration allows users to experience
immersive telepresence, interact with digital twins, and work
together in spaces that erase the boundaries of the real
and virtual. Seamless travel, individualized experiences, and
context-based communication in the Metaverse are facilitated
by using spatio-temporal data representation (STDR) and AI.
But even so, bandwidth constraints and scalability remain
the chief obstacles, so next-generation systems need to
have the capability of transferring large amounts of 3D
holographic data in real time. It will break those bottlenecks
to make holographic telepresence, virtual co-creation, and
AI spatial computing mainstream, making the Metaverse an
engaging, smart, and accessible virtual world [16]. Semantic
technologies play a crucial role in enabling efficient and
intelligent holographic communication through optimum
data transmission, low bandwidth usage, and optimized
real-time content reconstruction. Bit-by-bit transmission of
volumetric data is extremely bandwidth-hungry and inclined
towards gigabit-level bandwidth consumption for seamless
holographic streaming. Semantic communication prefers
transmitting only the significant, task-specific information
that is meaningful in comparison to the transmission of raw
3D data, thus reducing the load on the data significantly.
The SemHolo framework in the paper decomposes semantic
information into keypoints, 2D images, and text semantics
each with unique trade-offs of visual quality, computational cost, and storage. Keypoint-based semantics offer
light-weight descriptions of 3D shapes at the cost of requiring
high-level AI models to enable real-time reconstruction,
whereas image-based and text-based semantics employ deep
learning and NLP to produce high-fidelity output with low
latency. Although efficiency has been enhanced, real-time
semantic extraction, reconstruction overhead, and preservation of visual realism remain major hurdles in realizing
semantic-driven holographic communication at scale [141].
10) SPEECH SEMANTIC COMMUNICATION
Speech Semantic Communication (SSC) is a paradigm shift
in speech transmission by focusing on semantic meaning
extraction rather than raw audio signals, enhancing efficiency,
bandwidth usage, and real-time interaction significantly.
Unlike traditional speech transmission schemes that encode
and transmit entire audio waveforms, SSC employs AI
and Deep Learning to extract only the most important
semantic content, allowing for quicker and more precise
information delivery. This method enhances communication
efficiency in information-intensive applications such as
Metaverse-based applications and digital twin infrastructure
by reducing redundancy and task-relevant content. SSC also
uses NLP and context-aware learning algorithms to improve
intention, tone, and meaning interpretation to maintain
communication simplicity and responsiveness across various
virtual systems. However, challenges such as semantic misinterpretation, AI bias, and ensuring real-time adaptability
must be addressed so that the SSC can be fully utilized
by next-generation speech-based communication systems
[142]. Metaverse enables interactive and dynamic digital
communication since semantic speech processing increases
real-time and smart interaction. Semantic speech models in
comparison to voice-based traditional communication are
largely meaning-extracting and context-adjustable, which
enable effective low-latency communications across AIdriven virtual worlds. Integration of Semantic Communication and speech processing gives the capability of user intent,
tone, and context cues being understood better by AI-powered
avatars, digital assistants, and non-player characters. This
enhances natural language interaction, voice translation in
real-time, and emotion-sensing feedback, supporting engaging user experiences. Federated learning-inspired semantic
communication models help in ensuring data privacy during training AI models on Metaverse distributed servers.
However, problems such as semantic misinterpretation, AIpowered speech recognition bias, and bandwidth constraints
have to be addressed to harness optimum potential of speechdriven, semantic-aware interactions in Metaverse [143].
Semantic technologies provide the fundamental foundation
for intelligent speech communication based on successful
extraction, representation, and transmission of meaning.
In contrast to bit-by-bit transmission-based traditional systems, semantic-oriented models are designed for interpreting
and transmitting the intention behind speech instead of redundant information, thus communicating more efficiently. Such
systems make use of knowledge bases and context-aware
algorithms to dynamically decipher and refresh messages so
that speech data is made optimal for comprehension rather
than mere repetition. Semantic communication brings deep
learning models into harmony with structured ontologies
so that machine interpretation is enhanced, and interactions
are more fluid and intuitive. This approach is particularly
relevant in those contexts that demand high accuracy, such as
live virtual assistants and machine translation service, where
effective semantic mapping is capable of contributing notably
towards minimizing error and ambiguity [144].
11) TEXTUAL COMMUNICATION
Textual Communication is a fundamental component of
digital communication, serving as the primary medium for
conveying information, instructions, and context in real and
virtual environments. In multimodal digital spaces, such as
the Metaverse, text-based communication is complemented
by AI-based semantic processing so that context-aware, adaptive, and effective communication can be attained. In place of
reliance on traditional text conveyance, semantic models of
communication extract pertinent contextual meanings, such
that merely the most salient textual content is processed
and transmitted. Optimizing this facilitates enhanced humancomputer interaction, content generated through artificial
intelligence, and real-time virtual decision-making. Text
communication also serves as an interface connecting users to
AI systems, such that interactions can become more natural,
efficient, and structured for applications in the Metaverse.
But to enable meaningful and legitimate textual interactions
in AI-based virtual worlds, obstacles such as semantic
ambiguity, data redundancy, and context incompatibility must
be addressed [145]. The Metaverse is an extremely interactive
and multimodal virtual world, in which textual communication and AI-generated content are major drivers of user experiences. Unlike traditional online interactions, in which text
is static, the Metaverse integrates Semantic Communication
and AI-Generated Content to enhance textual communication
efficiency and contextual appropriateness. AI technologies
simultaneously extract, generate, and customize textual
information so that user input is made optimal for sense and
relevance rather than simply being transmitted in its original
form. The process maximizes bandwidth and the richness of
virtual interactions and therefore makes text communication
more responsive and personalized. Multimodal AI systems
process the text along with speech, visual data, and context
metadata so that interaction is adaptive and immersive.
However, problems such as real-time content adjustment,
privacy, and scalable AI models must be addressed in
order to enable intelligent and smooth text communication
in Metaverse environments [146]. Semantic technologies
constitute the intelligence layer in textual communication,
enabling efficient data interpretation, compression, and
transmission within digital environments, particularly within
the Metaverse. Unlike traditional text communication, which
transmits raw characters and symbols, AI models imbued
with semantics extract contextual meaning, user intent,
and relevance, such that only essential information is
processed and delivered. This technique obviates redundancy
of data, lowers bandwidth consumption, and enhances realtime flexibility, allowing text communication to become
more natural and interactive in immersive environments.
Knowledge graphs, Natural Language Processing, and AI
content filtering enhance textual communications through
organizing, categorizing, and filtering information before
transmission. In the Metaverse, where real-time interaction
is so critical, semantic encoding enables AI-driven assistants, virtual avatars, and digital agents to offer contextaware responses, predictive text prediction, and cross-lingual
translation with improved accuracy. Nevertheless, issues of
semantic drift, AI bias, and complexity of real-time semantic
adaptation must be addressed to enable accurate, unbiased,
and efficient communication in virtual environments [105].
12) SEMANTIC VIDEO COMMUNICATION
Semantic video communication enhances visual data transmission efficiency by focusing on semantic feature extraction
rather than explicit data transfer, significantly reducing
bandwidth consumption and computational burden. Instead
of transferring full video frames, semantic-aware AI systems
extract key visual features, such as human poses, object
movement, and scene context, to enable low-latency and
high-fidelity communication. This is particularly advantageous in Metaverse applications where ultra-low latency
real-time avatar synchronism and interactive environments
are required. The semantic edge computing and caching
models are introduced in [36], where domain-specific and
user-specific AI models are employed for predicting and
transmitting the most significant video features for better
efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, deep learning techniques
such as graph-based encoding and neural compression enable
dynamic adaptation to different types of video content to
preserve visual communication optimality while ensuring
contextual integrity. Semantic encoder-decoder model mismatches, real-time adaptation complexities, and perceptual
quality preservation are challenges that must be addressed
in order to fully utilize the benefits of semantic video
communication [36]. The Metaverse is a highly immersive,
data-intensive virtual world where video-based real-time
interactions require intelligent communication systems to
handle vast multimedia data streams. Unlike traditional
online worlds, where users interact primarily through text
or static media, Metaverse applications are founded on
high-fidelity 3D video, holographic communication, and
augmented/virtual reality to offer real-time, immersive experiences. The increasing requirement for low-latency, highdefinition video streaming poses serious bandwidth and
computation requirements, and semantic video communication becomes necessary to enhance data transmission.
Instead of raw video frame transmissions, semantic-aware
AI models sift and select only significant visual information,
mitigating network overloads while maintaining real-time
response. Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs)
and deep learning-based encoding models enhance video
quality and compression efficiency further to enable seamless
Metaverse interactions over 6G networks. Real-time synchronization, AI-driven scene reconstruction, and adaptive
video compression are challenges that must be addressed
to enable scalable, intelligent, and resource-efficient video
streaming in the Metaverse [147]. Semantic technologies
play a central role in optimizing video communication using
adaptive, context-aware, and efficient transmission methods
for data-intensive media such as the Internet of Senses
(IoS) and the Metaverse. Compared to conventional video
streaming methods based on bit-encoded transmission and
greater bandwidth usage, semantic-sensitive machine learning models access and override precious video content and
send only required information to provide low-latency, highdefinition interactions. Semantics technologies process video
streams dynamically in real time using machine learning
and edge intelligence to compress and recompress the video
streams with minimum computational processing burdens on
the infrastructure of networks. Partially Observable Markov
Decision Processes (POMDP) are employed in optimizing
the edge intelligence such that AI systems decide in real-time
about the video content processing and transmission depending upon limited yet situationally relevant observations.
These techniques enable improved user experience via
minimizing duplicate video data transmission, resulting in
smoother, more engaging experiences for applications such
as AR/VR communications, and collaboration using digital
twins. Filtering semantic noise, addressing AI bias, and
delivering real-time adaptability are some of the challenges to
be resolved to unlock the entire potential of semantic-driven
video communications [148]. Figure 6 shows the blockchain
related applications in the metaverse. Figure 7 shows the
large language models related applications in the metaverse.
Table 3 summarizes all metaverse applications and their
related technologies. Figure 8 exhibits 6G and edge learning
metaverse applications and Figure 9 shows semantic communication applications in metaverse.
C. AI APPLICATIONS IN THE METAVERSE
AI plays a crucial role in shaping the metaverse by enhancing
immersive experiences and enabling human-like intelligence
in virtual environments. By integrating AI with technologies
like machine learning, deep learning, and blockchain, the
metaverse can offer realistic interactions, intelligent virtual
agents, and adaptive digital ecosystems. AI-driven advancements in natural language processing, computer vision, and
neural interfaces contribute to building scalable, secure, and
highly interactive virtual worlds [46].
1) Perception and Imaging: AI enhances imaging systems
through computational imaging, depth estimation, and
real-time image reconstruction. Deep learning enables
high-speed imaging and encoding-based information
capture, improving visual realism in the metaverse [87].
2) Multi-Modality Sensors: AI-driven sensory processing
transforms data from various sensors into meaningful
insights, reducing latency and energy costs through
near-sensor and in-sensor computing [87].
3) Computation (Cloud and Edge Computing): AI optimizes cloud computing by enhancing security (e.g.,
DDoS detection), resource scheduling, and AI-as-aService (AIaaS). In edge computing, AI enables model
compression and inference engines for efficient processing on distributed devices [87].
4) Reconstruction and Digital Twins: AI facilitates the
reconstruction of realistic virtual environments from
sparse inputs using neural 3D representations. Digital
twins, powered by AI, simulate real-world objects
and spaces in the metaverse for precise modeling and
predictive analysis [87].
5) Interaction and Human-Computer Interfaces: AI-driven
NLP enhances communication in the metaverse through
chatbots, virtual assistants, and intelligent NPCs. AIpowered speech recognition and sentiment analysis
improve interaction with avatars and digital agents [46],
[87].
6) Machine Vision and Extended Reality (XR): AI
enhances computer vision tasks like object detection,
semantic segmentation, and human activity recognition.
AI also integrates with VR, AR, and MR to improve rendering, real-time tracking, and immersive experiences in
the metaverse [46], [87].
7) AI in Networking: AI optimizes bandwidth usage,
reduces latency, and enables adaptive data transmission
for real-time communication in the metaverse [46].
8) Cooperation and Social Interaction: AI enables seamless
virtual collaboration by enhancing real-time interactions
between users and AI-driven avatars, improving social
engagement in the metaverse [87].
9) Blockchain and AI for Security: AI enhances security
in the metaverse by integrating with blockchain for
decentralized authentication, fraud detection, and secure
transactions [46].
10) AI in Smart Cities and Healthcare: AI supports
metaverse applications in urban management and
telemedicine, providing real-time data analysis, predictive modeling, and AI-assisted diagnostics [46].
11) AI in Gaming and Virtual Entertainment: AI improves
gaming experiences by generating realistic NPCs,
balancing game mechanics, and enabling procedural content creation, making virtual worlds more
engaging [46].
AI significantly enhances the metaverse by improving
perception, computation, reconstruction, cooperation, and
interaction. AI-driven technologies such as deep learning,
neural networks, and advanced imaging enable realistic
virtual environments, efficient computing, and seamless
user interactions. Despite rapid advancements, challenges
remain in developing scalable, secure, and fully immersive
AI-powered metaverse applications. Future research should
focus on optimizing AI integration to make the metaverse
more practical, intelligent, and accessible [87].
III. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR THE METAVERSE
To deliver a smooth and engaging metaverse experience
for individuals and multi-users, combining objective Quality
of Service (QoS) and subjective aspects that contribute to
the Quality of Experience (QoE) is essential. As shown
in Table 4, QoS includes technical aspects like high
bandwidth, low latency, dependable data transmission, and
jitter management to guarantee good network performance.
On the other hand, QoE goes beyond these quantitative
measurements and considers the user’s overall perception
of the service. To ensure a superior user experience in
extended reality (XR) and metaverse environments, it is
crucial to achieve a strong sense of immersion and presence.
This can be accomplished by focusing on high frame rates,
resolution, and field of view. Additionally, it is important
to prioritize responsiveness and interactivity, which can be
achieved by minimizing motion-to-photon (MTP) latency.
MTP is the delay between user action and visual feedback,
and it is a critical factor for immersive XR experiences within
the metaverse. Encompassing sensor detection, processing,
network transmission, and display rendering, high MTP
latency disrupts the sense of presence and realism, potentially
leading to motion sickness. Minimizing this latency is crucial
for ensuring smooth interactions and responsive feedback,
enabling users to perceive a seamless connection between
their actions and the virtual environment. In addition, the
combination of various feedback sensory inputs, including
touch, smell, and sound, along with visually stunning
elements such as detailed images, three-dimensional models,
and immersive audio, all contribute to a captivating and
pleasurable user experience that goes beyond just technical
features [25]. Figure 10 summarizes the main metaverse
requirements.
1) Persistent: Virtualizing reality through digital twins
and avatars enhances the metaverse experience by
providing a more immersive experience for users.
Users interact with each other through their customized
avatars [149]. However, those avatars should be always
online and active even when the corresponding user is
FIGURE 6. Blockchain applications in metaverse.
TABLE 3. Summary of applications and techniques.
not. Moreover, they need to act the same as the users
act when they are online, and this is persistent in the
metaverse. We did a comprehensive search on the most
known databases for persistence in the metaverse and
keeping the digital twin running, and the search showed
us a gap in research that could be taken as future work.
2) Realism: Engaging different current technology that
provides realism for the metaverse such as 360 video
streaming creates a sense of presence and engagement
using different motion sensors as in VR, or recreating
3D objects such as technologies in AR. In addition,
by creating a sensible element that simulates the real
sensing such as pressure as in haptic feedback and the
real taste or smell feedback of the objects overseas such
as [150], they managed to reproduce those exact salty
and sour flavors the sensors measured.
3) Security: As with any technology, user security and
privacy should be prioritized over any other requirement, especially in such widely open technology,
exploiting vulnerabilities is a potential gateway for
FIGURE 7. LLMs applications in metaverse.
cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access to sensitive
information [151]. Ensuring users’ trust, safety, and
privacy requires robust security measures [15].
4) Connectivity: Connecting the users with each other and
to the virtual environment requires effort. Connectivity
should be with low latency, high bandwidth, and reliable
network to meet metaverse requirements. Ensuring low
latency and high bandwidth with reliable network infrastructure is essential for consistent connectivity to the
virtual world, allowing for minimal delay between user
actions and corresponding responses with high-quality
audio and video transmission.
5) AI: AI plays a crucial role in the metaverse ecosystem,
and its integration is vital for its success. The abundance
of sophisticated metaverse data available for AI applications enhances user interaction and decision-making
capabilities. AI is rapidly changing how we engage
with video games by simulating intelligent behavior
like that of real-life players. Moreover, AI can aid
in creating intelligent decision mechanisms. This can
empower avatars with a level of autonomy, allowing
them to undertake tasks or engage in activities even in
the absence of their users. This fosters a more dynamic
and interactive.
6) Interoperability: To ensure that different technologies
used in the metaverse work well together, it’s necessary
to have a solid foundation that includes hardware,
protocols, and standards. This foundation is what allows
for interoperability, which means that virtual objects
and avatars can move seamlessly across the entire
metaverse. However, there are challenges to achieving
interoperability, especially when it comes to fast service
authorization, compliance auditing, and multi-source
data fusion, due to the differences in hardware, communication, and software used in different virtual worlds.
7) Scalability: To provide a smooth experience for users
while also being able to accommodate growth and
expansion in the future, it is important to have scalable
technologies. The metaverse should be capable of
handling a large number of concurrent users and avatars
interacting in real-time while maintaining a stable
network connection, low latency, and high frame rates.
Moreover, it should be able to support complex and
dynamic scenes with advanced physics, lighting, and
visual effects without compromising performance.
8) Accessibility: The metaverse should be available and
accessible to everyone, regardless of their status or
physical abilities. Accessibility concerns are particularly
important for individuals with physical or sensory
disabilities. For example, older adults may encounter
difficulties accessing the metaverse using VR headsets
that are not designed with their age group in mind.
This highlights the need to ensure that the metaverse
is accessible to everyone, regardless of their age or
physical abilities.
9) Ethics: The metaverse poses a significant risk to
user privacy, security, and safety. This is because the
metaverse is similar to a society, and as such, it is
prone to governance challenges. It is therefore important
to have regulations and policies in place to manage
user behavior and ensure their safety. To mitigate these
risks, privacy-enhancing technologies should be adopted
to protect sensitive data. Additionally, ethical design
principles should be implemented to encourage positive
interactions and reduce conflicts.
IV. INTERPLAY BETWEEN METAVERSE, SEMANTIC
COMMUNICATION, AND EDGE COMPUTING
This section investigates the interplay between the metaverse,
semantic communications, and edge computing.
A. HOW THE METAVERSE UTILIZES SEMANTIC
COMMUNICATION
The interplay between the metaverse, semantic communication, and edge computing is crucial in supporting the
metaverse. The metaverse relies on semantic communication
to communicate with IoT, edge, and AI devices. Furthermore,
AI and edge/cloud computing play a vital role in supporting
the metaverse by enabling real-time processing and decisionmaking capabilities, reducing latency, and improving the
accuracy and efficiency of communication [152]. Semantic
communication is extremely useful in achieving the minimum for the key applications. The synergy between 6G
scientific challenges has several key features and points
of contribution. Connected Intelligence aims to interconnect the digital, physical, and human worlds through a
high-performance network. Native AI/ML will be natively
integrated into the 6G system for application processing,
network optimization, and transmission techniques [153].
Sensing will be integrated as a service to enable a wide
range of applications with new Key Performance Indicators
(KPIs) [13]. Sub-THz and ultra-wideband technologies
FIGURE 8. 6G and Edge learning Metaverse applications and challenges.
will be used to achieve high data rates for extended
reality (XR)/virtual reality (VR)/augmented reality (AR)
and holographic communication applications. Intelligent
Sensing and Communications (ISAC) technology will enable
extreme sensing performance and efficient communication
with extreme KPIs in URLLC and coverage [152].
1) DIGITAL TWIN CREATION
The metaverse is envisioned as a digital copy of our physical
world. Hence, the first step in building the metaverse is the
creation of digital twins. A digital twin – as introduced in part
A of section I-D is a digitized copy of a physical entity and
its properties and it is crucial in many metaverse applications.
The initial construction of a digital twin would involve the
most intricate details and the constant update of the digital
twin’s status would overload the network with high traffic.
Yet, the load could be managed by introducing semantic
communication. There are several techniques for creating
digital twins most of them involve creating a graph-based
representation that describes the object’s properties and
its relationship with other entities. For instance, in [154],
the authors represent digital twin models by seven graph
nodes. These nodes summarize the properties, events, actions,
relations, etc. of the considered asset. With the aid of semantic
communication, the proposed model can be communicated
to construct the digital twin. Above that, semantics can be
used in the communication between different digital twins.
Jaimini et al. [155] proposed a data exchange layer that uses
FIGURE 9. Semantic communication applications in metaverse.
FIGURE 10. Metaverse minimum requirements.
knowledge graphs to communicate between two entities. This
layer acts as a first step in achieving interoperability and standardization in metaverse applications. The proposed method
provides scalability as the addition of a new tool involves
linking the new tool’s representation to the knowledge graph.
In [156], the authors address the challenges of limited
bandwidth and data volume in constructing accurate 3D
digital twins in the metaverse. The problem is to efficiently
transmit data from IoT devices to the Virtual Service Provider
(VSP) by transmitting only semantic information instead of
raw data. The paper proposes a reverse auction mechanism
and formulates the social welfare maximization problem as
an integer linear programming (ILP) model. The proposed
framework leverages existing IoT devices equipped with
sensors like cameras and radars to transmit their data to
the VSP. Semantic information extraction algorithms are
employed to extract valuable information from the raw data.
A AAV-BS is deployed to collect data from the region of
interest. A reverse auction mechanism is developed to select
IoT devices that can access wireless bandwidth and sell their
semantic information to the VSP. The proposed mechanism
ensures incentive compatibility, fairness, and individual
rationality. The authors conducted extensive simulations
using real-world data to evaluate the proposed framework.
The experiments focus on evaluating the efficiency of the
proposed reverse auction algorithm compared to a heuristic
algorithm. The results demonstrate that the proposed ILP
reverse auction algorithm achieves optimal solutions for a
range of channels. Additionally, the impact of semantic
information transmission on the metaverse is evaluated by
TABLE 4. QoE and QoS requirements for immersive metaverse
experiences.
comparing it to raw data transmission. The results show that
semantic information transmission enables a higher number
of winners and contributes to a diverse range of data sources,
leading to higher social welfare and a higher quality virtual
environment. The experiments also analyze the impact of
semantic information extraction algorithms and input data on
the selection of winners. In [157], the authors address the
challenges of efficient data transmission from the physical
world to the metaverse, considering the large volume and
variety of data generated by wireless sensing devices. The
goal is to develop a semantic-aware sensing data transmission
framework that reduces data volume, enables human activity
recognition, and motivates frequent data uploads. The paper
also introduces a contest theory-based incentive mechanism
to enhance the efficiency and quality of data transmission.
The proposed framework incorporates semantic encoding
and a contest theory-based mechanism. Semantic encoding
extracts meaningful information from wireless sensing data,
such as channel frequency response (CFR) power, reducing
the amount of data transmitted. The encoding algorithm
uses semantic bases and extracts semantic features such as
amplitude, frequency, and phase. The semantic features are
transmitted to the receiver, where human activity recognition
is performed in a semantic space defined based on the
semantic features. Activity recognition is achieved using
the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier. To incentivize
data uploads, the authors propose a contest theory-based
strategy. Contest theory, which involves contestants investing
resources to win prizes, is applied to stimulate frequent
data uploads. The optimal award settings are derived to
maximize the total data uploading frequency, enhancing the
refresh rate of the metaverse and improving the user experience. The authors conducted real-world data collection and
verification experiments using an IEEE 802.11ac protocolbased platform. The experiments validate the effectiveness of
activity recognition in the semantic space and demonstrate
the advantages of semantic encoding within the contest.
Comprehensive numerical analysis is also performed to
evaluate the proposed framework’s performance. In [19], the
authors address the challenges and opportunities associated
with the metaverse, focusing on virtual transportation networks. It highlights the need for efficient data transmission,
fast virtual world construction, and secure synchronization
between the physical and virtual domains. The goal is to propose a semantic-aware sensing data transmission framework
that leverages AI-generated content (AIGC) and blockchain
technology to facilitate virtual transportation networks in
the metaverse while ensuring data integrity and security.
The proposed framework consists of three main components:
semantic extraction and transmission, AIGC in the metaverse,
and semantic transformation and verification. Semantic
extraction involves capturing real-world data using edge
devices and transmitting semantic data instead of the original
data. AIGC techniques are then utilized in the metaverse to
render images and create immersive experiences. Semantic
transformation and verification are employed to prevent
the usage of malicious semantic data, with the proposed
defence scheme utilizing blockchain and zero-knowledge
proof techniques. The authors also introduce a training-based
targeted semantic attack scheme that generates adversarial
semantic data without revealing the authentic semantic data.
This scheme enables the creation of visually dissimilar
but semantically similar data. Additionally, an incentive
mechanism is suggested to encourage participation and
cooperation within the proposed framework. The authors
validate the proposed framework through real-world data
collection and experiments on an image benchmark. The
performance of the semantic attack and defence schemes
is evaluated, demonstrating the effectiveness of the defence
scheme in distinguishing between adversarial and authentic
semantic data. The integration of AIGC and blockchain
technology enhances the security and authenticity of data
transmission within virtual transportation networks.
2) INTERACTION WITH IoT DEVICES
Range from wearables such as smartwatches and fitness
trackers to smart home appliances like thermostats, lighting
systems, and security cameras. Additionally, IoT devices are
increasingly being integrated into transportation, healthcare,
agriculture, and industrial applications. These devices can
collect and share data in real-time, enabling a more interactive
and personalized experience within the metaverse. The global
IoT market is estimated to generate a revenue of $1.1 trillion
by 2026 [158]. The incorporation of semantic communication
allows for better understanding and interpretation of data
generated by IoT devices, leading to more meaningful and
context-aware interactions [159]. Semantic communication
uses ontologies, vocabularies, and data models to create a
common language that can be understood by both humans
and machines, facilitating seamless communication between
devices and services. This common language enables
efficient data integration, interoperability, and information
sharing among heterogeneous devices and platforms, which
is essential for the metaverse’s success [160]. Furthermore,
semantic communication enhances the capabilities of IoT
devices by enabling them to process and analyze data
intelligently. For example, by using semantic technologies,
an IoT device can infer relationships between different data
points, recognize patterns, and make decisions based on the
context. This leads to more efficient resource usage and
smarter decision-making within the metaverse, ultimately
improving user experiences [161]. Examples of metaverse
projects that incorporate IoT devices include virtual reality
(VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications that integrate
with smart home systems or wearable devices. For instance,
a metaverse application could leverage data from smart
lighting systems, thermostats, and other sensors to create
immersive environments that adapt to user preferences and
real-world conditions [162]. In another example, a metaverse
experience could use data from wearable fitness trackers
to create personalized exercise routines or health-focused
experiences, enhancing user engagement and motivation.
As the metaverse continues to evolve, IoT devices equipped
with semantic communication capabilities will play an
increasingly important role in shaping immersive, contextaware, and personalized experiences. By bridging the gap
between the physical and digital worlds, these devices
will facilitate seamless interactions and contribute to the
creation of a truly interconnected and intelligent digital
environment. In [163], the authors address the challenges
of accurate data transmission and model compression for
deep learning (DL) models in Internet of Things (IoT)
networks. The limited resources of IoT devices, including
memory, computing power, and battery capacity, pose
significant obstacles to the widespread application of DL
in IoT. The key problems are ensuring accurate data
transmission in the presence of wireless channel distortions
and reducing the number of parameters in DL models to
overcome resource limitations. To address the challenges,
the authors propose a distributed semantic communication
system called L-DeepSC, specifically designed for IoT
networks. The system employs a semantic communication
approach, interpreting information at the semantic level
rather than as bit sequences. This involves a communication
receiver for raw data recovery, a feature extractor for
interpreting the meaning of the data, and an effects network
for producing desired effects based on the extracted features.
Jointly designing the receiver and feature extractor network
or merging them with the effects network enables error
correction at the semantic and effectiveness levels, improving
data transmission accuracy. The authors also introduce
network slimming techniques for DL model compression
in IoT devices. Parameter pruning eliminates unnecessary
connections or filters in DL models, reducing redundancy
without sacrificing accuracy. Quantization represents weight
parameters with lower precision, reducing the required
bit width and simplifying operations. These compression
techniques allow DL models to be compressed without
significant loss of performance. The proposed solution, LDeepSC, integrates the semantic communication approach,
deep de-noise network for channel state information (CSI)
refinement, and network slimming techniques for model
compression. By interpreting data semantically, refining
CSI, and compressing DL models, L-DeepSC addresses
the challenges of accurate data transmission and limited
resources in IoT devices. The results presented in the excerpt
evaluate the performance of L-DeepSC through numerical
simulations. The system is compared to traditional methods
under different fading channels, such as Rayleigh and
Rician fading channels. The effects of weight pruning, and
quantization are also investigated. The experiments involve
various parameters and settings. The results demonstrate
that L-DeepSC outperforms traditional methods, particularly
in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. The system
shows robustness to fading channels and achieves competitive
performance in terms of BLEU scores, which measure the
quality of translation or source recovery. The experiments
also reveal the effectiveness of network sparsification and
quantization in reducing model size while maintaining
performance.
B. INTEGRATION OF EDGE COMPUTING IN THE
METAVERSE
Mobile edge computing (MEC), along with artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology, has the potential
to accelerate the development of the metaverse through
6G communications. MEC platforms can create a network
ecosystem and value chain that enable major mobile operators, device providers, and third-party companies to adopt
new operating models [164]. The combination of MEC with
other emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain, and 6G
wireless communications will pave the way for significant
advancements in traffic applications. For instance, the use
of AI-based decision-making and cellular networks for
communication, combined with the collection and processing
of traffic, vehicle, and environmental information, can
facilitate the self-organization of production and reduce the
need for human intervention [165], [166], [167].
6G wireless communications will also provide flexibility
in networking smart devices, allowing them to use edge
computing, AI, blockchain, and other technologies for
data monitoring and interaction. This will create endless
possibilities for the integration of machine learning technology with the Internet of Vehicles, AR/VR/XR immersive
gaming, and traffic assistance systems. The integration of
semantic communication and edge computing is crucial to
the development of the metaverse, as it enables seamless
communication with IoT/edge/AI. The synthesis of MEC and
6G wireless networks will empower the metaverse to provide
a more immersive and high-fidelity experience, opening up
new opportunities for work and play based on blockchain,
AI, AR/VR/XR, and machine learning technology [168].
Optimizing resource allocation, the integration of edge
computing in the metaverse facilitates real-time processing
and analytics, enabling instantaneous smart applications and
immersive experiences. By optimizing resource allocation,
edge computing can manage data integration, analysis, and
computation closer to end devices, reducing traffic delay and
conserving cellular resources. User and task-centered AIbased Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) for metaverse applications The increasing popularity of metaverse applications has
brought forth new challenges in providing users with a seamless, immersive experience. The computationally intensive
nature of these applications, coupled with the dynamic and
time-varying systems encountered, puts a strain on existing
AI approaches and edge computing technologies. Moreover,
meeting both qualitative and quantitative requirements, such
as bridging the real and virtual worlds, creating a unified
world, and ensuring an immersive experience, is crucial
for a high-quality, true-to-life metaverse experience. So,
the authors of [169] propose a user and task-centered AIbased Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) solution designed
explicitly for metaverse applications. By focusing on the
needs of users and the tasks they perform, this solution
addresses the current limitations and optimizes edge computing technologies to handle the computational demands
of metaverse applications. The user and task-centered AIbased MEC fulfills not only qualitative and quantitative
requirements but also ensures ultra-high reliability and ultralow latency in communication and computation, ultimately
providing users with a superior metaverse experience. Multiaccess edge computing (MEC) autonomous aerial vehicles
(AAVs) are autonomous aerial vehicles that can be utilized
in edge computing to enhance the performance of B5G
Internet of Everything (IoE) networks [170]. MEC AAVs
act as aerial base stations and can assist in emergency
communications during natural disasters while offloading
computationally intensive tasks from IoE devices. Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) or deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) can be employed to integrate MEC AAVs into
MEC systems, improving system energy efficiency, speeding
up task completion, and reducing network computation costs.
Additionally, multiple MEC AAVs can collaborate to perform
AI tasks using their locally distributed data and computing
power [171]. Satellite communication is critical for providing
seamless coverage in remote and sparsely populated areas,
but satellite-served IoE networks face energy consumption,
computation delay, and capacity constraints. To optimize
the computation offloading process, machine learning-based
edge computing techniques such as deep deterministic
policy gradient or long short-term memory modules can
be used [172]. Furthermore, edge learning (EL) techniques
can be utilized for goal-oriented semantic communication,
wireless sensing, and edge caching in IoE networks. EL can
help extend intelligent services from a centralized cloud data
center to edge nodes in distributed IoE networks, reducing
transmission rates and improving computing accuracy and
speed. The principle of information bottleneck (IB) can be
used to characterize the relationships among the source,
transformed source, and desired information, facilitating the
use of EL for wireless sensing and edge caching tasks
in IoE networks [14]. Efficient edge resource allocation is
critical to enable the seamless operation of metaverse applications because of their stringent computational, storage,
and communication demands. Unlike traditional cloud-based
architectures, metaverse edge computing must dynamically
distribute processing, bandwidth, and storage resources
across decentralized nodes to meet ultra-low latency and
high throughput demands. The unique challenges of resource
scheduling in this scenario are real-time synchronization of
avatars and digital twins, high-resolution 3D scene rendering,
and adaptive offloading of tasks for workload balancing
across static and mobile edge nodes such as base stations,
AAVs, and roadside units. Furthermore, delivering quality
of experience (QoE) to users requires smart scheduling
methods that prioritize latency-sensitive applications such as
VR rendering and AI-driven interactions and allocate network bandwidth accordingly. Security and privacy concerns
add another layer of complexity because resource-sharing
mechanisms must be decentralized and secure from cyber
attacks. Advanced techniques, including machine learningoptimized optimization, blockchain for decentralized trade
of resources, and collaborative edge-cloud architectures, are
being put forward as solutions to these problems, rendering
the metaverse scalable, interactive, and immersive despite its
intensive resource demands [173].
V. OPEN CHALLENGES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The metaverse faces significant technological and social
challenges, including scalability issues due to high network and computational demands, security risks such as
identity theft and unauthorized data access, and blockchain
limitations in transaction throughput [174]. Ensuring low
latency and high reliability remains critical for immersive
experiences [174], while the integration of large language
models introduces concerns related to real-time processing
and bias [175]. Socially, the digital divide persists due to
infrastructure and accessibility barriers, content moderation
faces difficulties balancing free speech and governance,
and data ownership complexities arise with NFTs [176].
Future research should prioritize the enhancement of AIdriven infrastructure, the integration of quantum computing
for robust security and optimization, and the development
of advanced wearable technologies to enrich immersive
experiences within the metaverse [177]. Addressing these
challenges will require collaboration across industries to
develop scalable, secure, and inclusive metaverse ecosystems
[177]. This section describes the main open challenges,
summarized in Figure 11.
A. TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES
1) Scalability. Scalability challenge in the Metaverse result
from vast amounts of data needed and low-latency
needs, overwhelming current networks. The growth
of dynamic objects and avatars places extra load
on infrastructure. Networks must efficiently manage
diverse user demands and adapt to traffic fluctuations
without compromising performance [178].
• Networks in the metaverse must efficiently handle
a large number of users with diverse computational
demands and bandwidth requirements without compromising performance.
• Networks must be adaptable, responding to sudden
traffic fluctuations or changes in user location.
• Semantic communication relies on efficient learning,
which requires the appropriate handling, labelling,
and categorization of various data types.
• Blockchain: Significant scalability issues are brought
about by the metaverse’s incorporation of blockchain
technology, which affects the virtual worlds’ functionality and user experience [5]. Blockchain’s intrinsic constraints in processing speed and transaction
capacity become apparent as it functions as the
foundation for overseeing asset ownership, identity
verification, and transactional operations within the
metaverse [179], [180]. The large volume of constant,
real-time interactions and transactions needed for a
smooth and engaging metaverse experience is too
much for traditional blockchains to manage [20].
This leads to delay and bottlenecks in transactions,
which can interfere with user interactions and games,
making it difficult to keep virtual environments fluid
and dynamic [181]. The blockchain is further taxed by
the massive volume of data produced by conceivably
millions of users, which makes data management
and synchronization across a decentralized network
of nodes more difficult [182]. These scalability
problems are a major obstacle to the creation of
expansive and fully functional metaverse ecosystems
[92], [183].
2) Security and Privacy:Users need assurance that the
network provides a secure environment for their virtual
experiences. The network must maintain data integrity
and privacy during exchanges between devices and
applications.
a) Threats to Authentication in the Metaverse
• Identity Theft: In the metaverse, users are at
risk of having their avatars, digital assets, social
relationships and entire digital lives were stolen,
leading to significant losses, such as the $1.7 million loss in the Opensea NFT marketplace hack in
2022 [15].
• Impersonation Attack Hackers can create fake
avatars using digital replicas of victims to deceive,
defraud, and even commit crimes against the
victim’s friends in the metaverse [184].
• Avatar Authentication Issue: Authenticating
avatars is more challenging than real-world
identity authentication. Adversaries can create AI bots that mimic users’ appearances,
voices, and behaviors, making it difficult to
verify authenticity. This may require additional
personal information for secure authentication, potentially opening new privacy breach
issues [185].
• Trusted and Interoperable Authentication: Fast,
efficient, and trusted cross-platform and crossdomain identity authentication is essential for
users and avatars in the metaverse [186].
b) Threats to Access Control in the Metaverse
• Unauthorized Data Access: Complex metaverse
services generate various types of personal profiling data. Malicious Virtual Service Providers
(VSPs) may carry out unauthorized data access
attacks for their benefit, such as elevating their
rights through buffer overflow and tampering
access control lists [187].
• Misuse of User/Avatar Data: In the metaverse,
user/avatar-related data can be disclosed intentionally or unintentionally, leading to user profiling and targeted advertising activities. Noninteroperability between sub-metaverses makes it
challenging to trace data misuse activities [15].
c) Security Countermeasures for Metaverse Authentication and Access Control.
• Key Management for Wearable Devices: Efficient
key management schemes are crucial for wearable
devices, such as Oculus helmets and HoloLen
headsets, to establish secure communication and
deliver sensory data [188].
• Identity Authentication for Wearable Devices:
Ensuring device/user authenticity for wearable
devices is a promising topic in the metaverse.
Research should focus on cloud-based mutual
authentication models with low system costs
for wearable medical devices and continuous
authentication models to support seamless device
authentication [189].
• Cross-Domain Identity Authentication: Identity
authentication across distinct administrative
domains in the metaverse is critical for delivering
seamless services. Researchers should focus
on decentralized and transparent cross-domain
FIGURE 11. Metaverse challenges.
authentication schemes that leverage blockchain
technology [190].
• Fine-grained Access Control and Usage Audit
for Wearables and User-Generated Content
(UGC): Researchers should develop solutions
to protect personally identifiable information
handled by wearables and ensure secure access
control and usage audit for UGC in the
metaverse [191].
3) Challenges and opportunities in edge learning for 6G
wireless communication networks: The Edge Learning
(EL) framework faces a significant challenge. The
framework offers a distributed implementation of the
algorithms; however, the large-dimension ML parameters, coupled with their frequent updates, generate
a substantial amount of data traffic. This poses a
significant strain on wireless communication networks
and can limit the effectiveness of the EL framework.
The development of EL systems for wireless communication networks in 6G presents both challenges
and opportunities. One of the primary challenges
is to overcome the information-theoretic limits of
communication networks and devise new theoretical
frameworks for optimizing communication for EL and
computing tasks. Additionally, the architectural and
technical challenges of EL must be addressed, such
as the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of B5G
networks, non-independent and identically distributed
datasets, and resource allocation. However, there are
also research opportunities to explore in EL, particularly
in emerging applications like blockchain, quantum computing, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), and the
metaverse [192]. These opportunities suggest that B5G
will be a comprehensive information processing and
service network with advanced sensing, communication,
and computing capabilities to support EL and other
novel applications[14]. Developing effective knowledge
based (KB) systems presents a significant challenge,
as their success hinges on the demanding requirements
of achieving precise accuracy and consistency in knowledge representation, while simultaneously ensuring
semantic equivalence between messages. Failure to
address these challenges during the design and implementation stages may result in suboptimal performance
of KB systems in real-world applications. Therefore,
careful consideration of these factors is essential for the
development of successful KB systems[193]. Designing
and implementing fog-based energy-aware 6G-enabled
massive IoT architectures, policies, and applications
comes with several challenges that must be addressed.
These challenges include resource management, which
involves efficiently managing computing and storage
resources, finding available fog nodes, and balancing
energy consumption, QoS requirements, and resource
utilization [194]. Heterogeneity is another challenge that
requires addressing the differences in software and hardware, and energy-efficient policies that are hard to apply
due to the heterogeneity of the IoT-enabled fog environment. Balancing energy efficiency and QoS awareness is
also challenging, as it requires finding a balance between
energy savings and QoS requirements, such as when
consolidating devices, turning off underutilized devices
or their components, and ensuring timely redirection
of incoming IoT traffic. Selecting an appropriate
energy-efficient approach is also challenging, taking
into consideration highly heterogeneous environments
and service-level agreements of IoT applications. The
challenge of efficiently allocating reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to multiple IoT nodes using
matching theory-based algorithms is also a challenge.
Federated learning poses another challenge, requiring
finding a global learning model using local models
trained on different data sets for energy-aware task
offloading. Lastly, developing incentive mechanisms to
motivate fair and honest cooperation among devices for
energy cooperation, where nodes with higher available
energy can perform tasks on behalf of nodes with lower
energy, is also a challenge [195]. The development
of 6G networks poses numerous challenges that must
be addressed for them to be successful. One of the
major challenge is the need for intelligent and adaptive
connectivity that can integrate various communication
technologies and efficiently manage network resources
to provide the best possible user experience. Another
challenge is the creation of new computing architectures
capable of handling the massive amounts of data and
AI tasks required for intelligent communication systems. Edge computing and intelligence will be critical
components of 6G networks, enabling low-latency and
high-bandwidth communication as well as real-time
data analysis and decision-making. Federated learning
is another challenge that must be addressed for 6G to
learn from a vast amount of data while preserving user
privacy [196]. Furthermore, there is a growing need
for AI-based decision transparency and interpretability
to ensure trustworthiness and ethics. AI in wireless
security can aid in the detection and prevention of
various types of attacks, such as network intrusion,
data theft, and identity fraud. AI can also optimize
network resources, improve network performance, and
reduce power consumption, making 6G more efficient
and environmentally friendly. Finally, deep learning
can enable intelligent semantic communications, which
enables machines to understand and communicate
with humans in natural language and context [197].
Addressing these issues will be critical to the success of 6G networks, which have the potential to
transform the way we communicate and interact with
one another. In particular, the development of 6G
networks has significant implications for the future of
the metaverse, which relies on seamless, low-latency,
and high-bandwidth communication between users and
their digital environments. By enabling more efficient
and intelligent communication systems, 6G networks
could significantly enhance the user experience of the
metaverse and unlock new applications and services.
However, addressing the challenges outlined above will
be necessary to fully realize the potential of 6G in the
context of the metaverse. The intersection of Mobile
Edge Computing (MEC), Artificial Intelligence (AI),
Blockchain technology, and 6G wireless communications is poised to revolutionize the development of the
metaverse. The deployment of MEC platforms and the
establishment of new industry standards will create
an ecosystem that enables major mobile operators,
device providers and third-party companies to adopt
new operating models, ultimately driving innovation
in network services [164]. The combination of MEC
with emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain,
and 6G wireless communications offer a plethora of
advancements in traffic applications, including AIbased decision-making, communication through cellular networks, and the collection and processing of
traffic, vehicles, and environmental information. With
the advent of 6G, smart devices can be flexibly
networked to utilize edge computing, AI, blockchain,
and other technologies for data monitoring and interaction, enabling the self-organization of production
and reducing the need for human intervention. MEC,
strengthened by AI and blockchain, can enhance the
efficiency and security of mobile edge computing.
With 6G wireless networks, the convergence of AI and
blockchain-aided MEC for the metaverse is an exciting
prospect that promises to provide a more immersive
and high-fidelity experience. This synthesis will further
strengthen the capabilities of MEC and 6G wireless
networks, leading to improved computation and energy
resources and ultimately increasing system efficiency.
The advancements in 6G performance indicators, with
most indicators increasing by 10 to 100 times compared
to 5G, will unlock limitless opportunities for innovation
in network services. As these technologies continue to
evolve, mobile networks will introduce a range of new
opportunities for work and play, including high-fidelity
metaverse experiences based on blockchain and AI
technologies, immersive gaming with AR/VR/XR based
on 6G wireless networks, and traffic assistance systems
and smart driving systems integrated with the Internet
of Vehicles and machine learning technology. To realize
the full potential of MEC, AI, blockchain, and 6G
wireless communications, researchers and engineers
must collaborate to develop new industry standards and
platforms. Future works should focus on advancing the
development of MEC platforms and creating new industry standards that will enable the seamless integration of
these technologies. Additionally, efforts should be made
to explore the potential of these technologies in areas
such as smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and Industry
4.0. By doing so, we can unlock the full potential of these
technologies and drive further innovation in network
services. In the context of the metaverse, research should
focus on developing advanced semantic communication
technologies that enable natural language interactions
between users and their digital environments. This
will require the development of new techniques for
representing knowledge and semantics, as well as new
approaches for integrating machine learning algorithms
into communication systems.
4) Latency and reliability: One of the key challenges in the
development of 6G-IoT systems and the implementation
of FL is scalability and resource constraints. The
massive scale of IoT devices and the limited availability
of network resources poses challenges to the design
and implementation of efficient FL algorithms [198].
Another challenge is the heterogeneity and non-IID
data produced by IoT devices, which can affect the
performance of FL algorithms [199]. Ensuring data
security and privacy is a major concern in IoT networks,
especially when using decentralized learning algorithms
like FL [200]. Latency and reliability also present
challenges, as the performance of FL algorithms in
6G-IoT networks is significantly impacted by latency
and reliability issues in wireless communication channels [201]. Integration and optimization of enabling
technologies, such as network slicing, cloud computing,
AI, blockchain, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
are essential to achieving their full potential of 6G-IoT
systems and FL [202]. Finally, standardization and interoperability are crucial for the successful deployment and
interoperability of 6G-IoT systems and FL algorithms
across different devices and networks [203]. To address
these challenges, researchers must continue to advance
and refine FL algorithms, develop new frameworks
for IoT networks, and work on the integration and
optimization of various enabling technologies.
5) Challenges in semantic communications and networks
for emerging technologies: The research of semantic
communications and networks faces a multitude of
challenges and issues that require urgent attention.
One of the emerging technologies in this field is
Immersive Extended Reality (XR), which combines the
features of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality
(VR). For designing XR systems, strict requirements
for accuracy, human characteristic diversity, data rates,
and latency need to be met. Additionally, large-scale
AI/ML models must be implemented efficiently for
training and inference support [204]. Another promising
area is Holographic Communication, which involves
transmitting and receiving 3D holograms of humans or
physical objects. Achieving real-time and seamless integration of human-to-machine and machine-to-machine
techniques requires enhancing semantic communication
processes’ efficiency and speed [205]. All Sense Communication, a subset of 6G communications, employs
sensor ensembles mounted on devices or wearables.
Integrating all sense data effectively with holographic
communication helps facilitate tactile communications
and haptic control. However, managing the exponential
complexity in applications due to the diverse types
of sensing signals pose a significant challenge [206].
Compressed sensing is an essential signal-processing
method in semantic communications. Developing an
optimal sampling technique that combines signal
sparsity and semantics for real-time prediction and
reconstruction remain a major challenge, considering
various constraints and latency [207]. Optimizing packet
structure and understanding the feedback’s role in
real-time channel environments are crucial for saving
miscellaneous operations over packet data. Additionally,
scheduling and resource allocation policies for semantic communications need to consider system energy
optimization. The high complexity of semantic-enabled
networks requires sharing knowledge among users.
Developing a mathematically enabled framework to
evaluate performance limits imposed by the semantic
network is necessary. Tracking and modeling human
knowledge upgrades can help improve communication
efficiency and minimize error probability within the
semantic network.
6) Blockchain in Metaverse challenges. The metaverse
benefits greatly from blockchain technology, but there
are also a number of issues that must be resolved for
it to be successfully integrated and widely used [179],
[208]. The following are some of the main challenges
in implementing blockchain in metaverse applications,
as illustrated in Figure 12:
a) Scalability: Blockchain networks are susceptible to
scalability problems, particularly if they are not
constructed with high throughput in mind [209].
The underlying blockchain needs to be capable of
efficiently managing high amounts of activities as
metaverse settings expand and the volume of transactions rises [210]. Problems with scalability might
result in increased expenses and delayed transaction
times [211].
• Blockchain Scalability issues solutions: Scalability issues of blockchain in the metaverse revolve
mainly around requirements of dealing with a
wide network of transactions and interactions
in a digitally rich and advanced universe [119].
With the metaverse demanding this very need
for real-time processing of various activities,
such as the trading of virtual goods, social
interactions, and enjoying gaming, all of which
necessitate a significantly higher transaction
throughput than Bitcoin and Ethereum, current
common blockchain technology adapt currently
[20]. There are two issues with these platforms:
network congestion and slow transaction speeds
during relatively heavy usage, which may cause
user experience deceleration that will lag in a
metaverse environment [212]. Limited throughput
that leads to high transaction fees and longer
set times of processing, will not be enough,
even for the world where real-time queues are
so important [213]. Subsequently, the fact that
each node stores all the complete copies of the
blockchain aggravates the storage data issues,
hence, making it hard for the system to grow
linearly as the transaction interactions scale up
[214]. Besides the scalability problems, there
are different innovative solutions proposed to
include blockchain in metaverse applications due
to their limited ability [52], [57]. Layer 1 solutions
like sharding and new consensus mechanisms
like Proof of Stake (PoS) are being explored
to improve the system agreements of the base
layer as it moves into the upgraded system
agreements [215], [216]. Sharding creates many
smaller blocks chains that can work by themselves
and so they can process more transactions, hence,
the total capacity of the network is increased
[217], [218]. The major advantage of shifting
from PoW to PoS is that this transition leads to
a dramatic decrease in energy consumption and
a significant increment in transaction throughput
[219], [220]. In addition, as layer 1 solutions
are being improved, layer 2 solutions like state
channels and sidechains come into the picture as
a complement, carrying out transactions off the
main blockchain which greatly helps to lighten
the load of the network without sacrificing the
security and integrity of the transactions [221],
[222]. On the other hand, developments such
as the use of the Lightning Network for the
transfer of Bitcoin and rollups in the case of
Ethereum allow for transactions to be temporarily
processed off-chain and later sum up on the main
blockchain improving the level of transactions
and consequently cutting the latency [223], [224].
Those solutions will be the required means for
scenarios involving transactions that need a quick
pace and high frequency typical for activities
in the metaverse [225]. A mix of both Layer
1 and Layer 2 solutions comprise a multilayered
approach to solving the issue of blockchain
scalability, which is particularly important for the
complex and transaction-intensive inside of the
metaverse [226], [227]. The construction of such
an underlying lets the metaverse potentially work
better so the consumers can have smoother and
more efficient experiences [228]. These solutions
are summarized in Figure 13.
b) Energy Consumption: Certain blockchain networks
consume a lot of energy, especially those that
employ proof-of-work (PoW) consensus techniques
[229]. This gives rise to environmental problems,
particularly as metaverse platforms grow in size and
utilization [230].
c) User Experience: The user experience with blockchain
technology can occasionally become more complicated due to problems with handling private
keys, comprehending wallet security, and navigating
the intricacies of bitcoin transactions [231]. The
technology underlying blockchain-based metaverses
must become more approachable and accessible to
non-technical people in order to be widely used [55],
[232].
d) Privacy Concerns: Blockchain records all transactions
on a public ledger, which might be a privacy issue
even though pseudonymity can improve user privacy
[233], [234]. One of the biggest challenges in creating
blockchain systems for the metaverse is striking a
balance between privacy and transparency [52], [235].
e) Regulatory and Legal Issues: Blockchains’ decentralized and international character presents regulatory
issues, especially in terms of adhering to local laws
and regulations [236]. This covers matters pertaining
to data privacy regulations, financial transactions, and
the protection of virtual property rights [237].
f) Security Risks: Blockchain is not impervious to
attacks, despite its general security [238]. For example, smart contract flaws can be used to steal money
or tamper with the metaverse ecosystem [239].
Maintaining the integrity of the metaverse requires
regular audits and strong security measures [15],
[240].
g) Economic Inequality: Wealthier users may control
the virtual real estate and asset market, concentrating
power and wealth inside the metaverse and raising the
likelihood of economic inequality [241], [242]. This
has the ability to mimic or worsen socioeconomic
problems that exist in the real world [243].
7) Large language models challenges in Metaverse: The
integration of LLMs into the Metaverse poses distinct
issues arising from the interplay between the virtual
environments and technology [67]. The following are
some of the primary difficulties in applying LLMs in the
metaverse, as summarized in Figure 14:
a) Real-Time Interaction: Requiring real-time interactions is common in the metaverse [244]. Although
LLMs are fast at processing and producing responses,
the need for instantaneous, contextually relevant
interactions in a dynamic, three-dimensional virtual
environment might strain the capabilities of existing
technologies, particularly when managing several
users at once [67], [245].
b) Context Awareness: LLMs must have a keen understanding of the metaverse’s context [246]. This
encompasses the spatial, social, and temporal contexts
of interactions in addition to the immediate conversational environment [247]. It is difficult to get this
FIGURE 12. Blockchain challenges in metaverse.
level of situational awareness since it necessitates
a complex integration of the model with the data
streams of the metaverse [248], [249].
c) User Experience and Immersion: It is important to
keep the user’s immersion intact in the metaverse
[250]. LLMs are required to produce answers that
enhance the immersive experience in addition to
being accurate [67], [251]. This involves speaking
in a way appropriate for the characters, setting, and
intended tone—all of which might change greatly
throughout virtual worlds [175], [252].
d) Scalability: Scalability is an issue for LLMs in the
metaverse, just like it is with blockchain [253], [254].
Thousands or millions of users can interact with an
LLM at the same time, requiring a large amount
of computer power and effective model scaling
techniques [255], [256].
e) Privacy and Security: Privacy concerns arise when
LLMs are used, particularly when personal data is
processed by these models to customize interactions
[257]. Keeping data secure from breaches and ensuring that data management conforms with privacy
standards are important challenges [257].
f) Bias and Fairness: Biases in training data can be
carried over into or amplified by LLMs [258].
Such prejudices have the potential to cause unfair
or improper interactions in the diverse and global
metaverse setting, alienating users or reinforcing
stereotypes [259].
g) Integration with Other AI Technologies: Combining
LLMs with other AI technologies, such computer
vision, emotional computing, and more, can be
beneficial for the metaverse [260]. It is theoretically
challenging to coordinate these various AI systems so
they can function as a single unit in real time [261].
h) Economic and Resource Inequality: Because advanced
LLM deployment might be resource-intensive, it may
come to a situation where only well-funded metaverse
settings can afford to integrate these technologies,
which would increase the gap in user experience and
capability between various virtual worlds [68], [262].
i) Continuous Learning and Adaptation: The metaverse
is a quickly changing environment [263]. LLMs must
always be learning new material and adjusting to
slang, cultural changes, and user behavior [264],
[265]. One major ongoing problem is to make sure the
model stays current without sacrificing the integrity or
reliability of its outputs [266], [267].
8) Metaverse Network Security and Situational Awareness:
Metaverse network security and situational awareness
problems arise due to the complexity and diversity
of the virtual environment, which make it challenging
to deploy and maintain security solutions as well as
evolve in response to new threats. In addition, the
absence of visibility within the metaverse limits the
detection and response to the security threats, leaving
the system vulnerable to cyberattacks and unauthorized
access [268]. Examples of security threats, single points
FIGURE 13. Solutions for Blockchain scalability issues in the metaverse.
of failure (SPoF), distributed denial of service (DDoS),
and Sybil attacks, which compromise integrity and user
experience [269]. Developing effective countermeasures
and enhancing situational awareness are crucial for
monitoring security and detecting threats in complex
metaverse environments.
• Future works: To improve metaverse network security, researchers can focus on developing robust
and scalable security solutions, leveraging innovative
technologies and methods such as blockchain and
artificial intelligence (AI) [269]. Enhancing situational awareness within the metaverse can also
be explored, utilizing advanced technologies like
augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and
machine learning to monitor and detect networkrelated threats. Moreover, the development of collaborative honeynet services present a promising
approach to securing the metaverse by trapping
attackers, monitoring their behavior, and exchanging
information with other honeynets [270].
• Example: Consider a user in the metaverse purchasing
virtual goods using virtual currency. A Sybil attacker
creates multiple fake identities and manipulates them
to exert undue influence on the metaverse services,
leading to a compromise of the system. In response,
countermeasures such as proactive defence mechanisms, situational awareness, and collaborative honeynet services can be employed to detect and mitigate
the attack. Machine learning algorithms can be
trained to recognize Sybil attackers’ behavior, and
virtual honeypots can be set up to trap malicious
activities [271]. Implementing these measures can
help protect the network from threats and improve the
overall security of the metaverse.
9) Energy consumption: The authors in [272] highlight
the increasing interest and investment in the metaverse, driven by advancements in enabling technologies
and the acceleration of digital experiences due to
the COVID-19 pandemic. While existing massively
multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs)
offer immersive experiences, the metaverse aims to go
beyond them by incorporating user-generated content,
decentralization, and interoperability across platforms
and devices. However, the authors acknowledge the
technical challenges, including communication speed,
computing power, data storage, and social barriers,
that need to be addressed for the successful realization
of the metaverse. The authors specifically focus on
energy consumption, efficiency, and sustainability of the
metaverse, highlighting the lack of research in this area.
It introduces the concept of metaverse sustainability
and proposes a framework called Green metaverse
Networking (GMN) to optimize the energy efficiency
of various network components. The authors analyze
four energy-intensive enabling technologies in the
metaverse: digital twin, artificial intelligence, extended
FIGURE 14. LLMs challenges in metaverse.
reality, and blockchain. For each technology, it discusses their energy consumption, efficiency, and factors
influencing their energy requirements. In the digital
twin domain, the authors emphasize IoT devices’ role
and suggest considering quality of experience (QoE)
metrics to evaluate network performance and reduce
energy consumption. The authors address the energy
consumption of AI, particularly the energy-intensive
process of AI training. It highlights the need to develop
energy-efficient AI models and discusses the trade-offs
between accuracy and energy consumption. Extended
reality technologies, including VR and AR, are examined in terms of their energy consumption and quality
of service (QoS) metrics. The authors emphasize the
importance of QoE-based energy efficiency metrics to
evaluate VR systems accurately. The energy challenges
of blockchain technology, such as the energy consumption of consensus mechanisms like Proof-of-Work
(PoW) and the redundancy of blockchain operations,
are discussed. The authors highlight the transition
to more energy-efficient consensus mechanisms like
Proof-of-Stake (PoS). The proposed Green metaverse
Networking framework aims to optimize the energy
efficiency of enabling technologies in the metaverse,
thereby contributing to its sustainable development.
10) Cross-disciplinary metaverse research: Interdisciplinary
metaverse research is stymied by bringing together
disparate methodologies, terminologies, and ethics from
fields such as computer science, psychology, law, and
economics[35]. Lack of mutually compatible data structures for interoperability and security hinders collaboration [273]. Ethical concerns regarding privacy of users,
digital identity management, and algorithmic bias are
not dealt with because of discrepancies in disciplinary
contexts [274]. Immersive virtual environments at large
scales are usually troubled by offering high fidelity
due to computational limitations, impacting real-time
performance and scalability, leading to challenges in
maintaining consistent visual fidelity and accuracy
of interaction [275]. Addressing such issues requires
convergent research agendas and cross-disciplinary collaboration for identifying best practices and regulatory
frameworks [35].
B. SOCIAL AND ETHICAL CHALLENGES
1) Digital divide: The digital divide represents a significant social and ethical challenge in the metaverse
and semantic communication era. The term ‘‘digital divide’’ refers to the gap between Individuals,
households, businesses, or geographical areas at different socio-economic levels concerning both their
opportunities to access information and communication
technologies (ICTs) and to use the Internet for a
variety of activities [276]. The advent of the metaverse, a collective virtual shared space created by the
convergence of physically virtually enhanced reality,
and the burgeoning growth of semantic communication,
which promises more meaningful and context-aware
interactions, are set to transform how we live, work,
and interact. However, these new technologies also risk
exacerbating the digital divide [276]. On one hand, the
metaverse and semantic communication offer unprecedented opportunities for social inclusion and economic
growth. They allow for more immersive, interactive, and
personalized experiences, making digital interactions
more meaningful and efficient [277]. However, these
technologies require advanced infrastructures, highspeed Internet, and sophisticated devices, often not
available in disadvantaged areas or to individuals of
lower socio-economic status. This might leave behind
those who do not have access to these resources,
widening the digital divide and creating a new form of
inequality in the ‘metaverse era’ [278]. Furthermore,
metaverse and semantic communication rely heavily on
advanced digital skills. Even if the infrastructure issues
are addressed, individuals lacking such skills might
find it challenging to participate fully in these digitally
immersive environments, which might lead to social
exclusion [279]. The digital divide in the context of the
metaverse and semantic communication is a complex
issue requiring multi-faceted solutions. Policymakers,
technology companies, and educators will need to work
together to address it. Potential solutions could include
public investment in digital infrastructure, programs
to make devices more affordable, and digital literacy
education to ensure individuals can participate fully
in the metaverse [280]. Future research should focus
on understanding the impacts of the metaverse and
semantic communication on different social groups and
devising strategies to ensure that these technologies
contribute to reducing, rather than exacerbating, social
and economic inequalities.
2) Content moderation: In the metaverse, multiple users
from different backgrounds will be able to post a variety
of contents and share it with other users. To regulate
this content, it is important to consider certain content
moderation techniques. Digital censorship refers to the
suppress of some ideas or actions due to their violations
of certain regulations or norms or due to their negative
impact on society. Although censorship may sacrifice
a certain degree of freedom of speech, it should be
deployed to regulate and moderate the metaverse’s
content. There are certain challenges associated with
implementing censorship in the metaverse. Firstly, there
is no clear methodology for implementing censorship
in metaverse. Secondly, how would users’ content
be migrated between sub-metaverses that implement
different censorship rules and regulations [281]. In general, the digital content that is posted by users in
the metaverse has to be examined by a governing
entity. According to [15], digital governance and content
moderation can be implemented by three different
techniques all these techniques need to be transparent,
respect human right and publicly accountable. AI models can be used to classify users’ contents and to
detect misbehaving or abnormal user accounts. Yet,
AI models can be biased and unfair as their performance
is highly dependent on the used training set. Besides
AI, blockchain technology and smart contracts can offer
decentralized and collaborative governance. Finally,
trusted digital forensics can be utilized to moderate
content by examining digital fingerprints and ensuring
the content’s authenticity.
3) Authoring tools in the metaverse would allow users
to create different forms of digital content. The ownership of the created content must be protected in
the metaverse. Work in [281] stated that the lack
of centralized authority in the metaverse makes it
challenging to trace the ownership of users’ generated
content. Blockchain technology can be used to trace
digital ownership; the public ledger can be used to
record the assets’ originality and all the operations that
involved it [15]. To preserve data ownership, NFTs
can be used. NFTs are unique non-fungible digital
tokens that are used to preserve an asset’s uniqueness
and authenticate one’s ownership. This protects the
production’s value and facilitates the trading of digital
assets [37]. Although NFTs guarantee the ownership
of a digital creation, NFT-related fraud still happens.
Attackers might exploit certain vulnerabilities in NFTs
and transfer their ownership. Counterfeit NFTs can be
created and sold once an NFT is minted on multiple
blockchains. It is possible to employ chronological asset
tracking in order to counter such security attacks on
NFTs [282].
C. FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
Future research directions include exploring new applications
and use cases, as well as innovations in infrastructure and
technology.
1) New applications and use cases. In the future, the
metaverse could be used for new applications in
different sectors. For instance, multiuser immersive
streaming applications can emerge to provide a seamless
experience for multiple users at the same time [37]. The
metaverse could be used to improve the productivity and
scalability of the manufactured products by improving
communication between digital twins or cobots with
human users in the virtual manufacturing space [282].
The collected data from various industrial lines can
be used to enhance the production further [37]. Real
Estate management systems could be realized by the
metaverse, and transactions between buyers, sellers, and
brokers can be done by the exchange of NFTs [282].
The Vehicular metaverse enhances safety and efficiency by effectively integrating immersive streaming
and real-time synchronization between vehicles [37].
Future developments in low-latency streaming, content
adaptation using AI, and edge-cloud computing will
enable real-time, high-fidelity virtual experiences for
multiple users. This will revolutionize virtual events,
gaming, and learning, enabling effortless collaboration
in immersive spaces. AI-powered avatars and haptic
feedback integration will also enhance user interaction and engagement. Remote work and entertainment
industries will shift to more interactive, real-time digital
spaces[37]. Digital twins powered by AI and cobots will
create self-optimizing, real-time adaptive manufacturing
systems. Factories will be highly automated, with less
manual intervention and greater efficiency. Designers
and engineers will collaborate in virtual environments,
testing prototypes before actual production. This will
bring about faster product development cycles and
reduced operating costs, transforming traditional manufacturing [37]. The metaverse will combine IoT, AI,
and blockchain to analyze industrial data in realtime, leading to predictive maintenance and adaptive
manufacturing. Smart factories will self-correct errors,
staying efficient and reducing downtime. Supply chains
will be more robust, with AI predicting disruptions
and optimizing logistics. Cybersecurity will also be
enhanced, with secure, tamper-proof industrial data
management [37]. The property transactions will be
more transparent and decentralized through the use of
NFT-based ownership and smart contracts. Buyers will
have virtual tours of properties prior to purchases, eliminating geographical constraints. Fractional ownership
through blockchain-based tokenization will facilitate
real estate investment using smaller capital. All these
will reduce the reliance on brokers and make complex
property transactions easier [283]. Autonomous vehicles
will use 5G/6G, AI, and real-time metaverse simulations
to enhance safety and efficiency. Vehicles will exchange
data freely on V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) networks,
optimizing traffic flow and preventing accidents. Realtime AI simulations will train autonomous systems
to improve decision-making. It will lead to smarter,
more personalized in-car experiences and more efficient
transportation systems [284].
2) Innovations in infrastructure and technology deployment of the metaverse’s meta spaces can be done
via shared hardware. The hardware must be shared
efficiently, and the access network resources can be
sold to metaverse’s users based on their user experience
requirements. To serve the huge amount of users,
zero-touch or autonomous networking can be used.
This technology automates the process of allocating
computation and communication resources to perform
efficient signaling [99]. FL-based network slicing (NS)
is considered a promising concept for effectively
utilizing limited wireless resources and catering to
various IoT applications’ QoS requirements. Intelligent
decision-making in challenging resource allocation scenarios can be achieved through FL-based NS, which can
efficiently handle a massive number of network slices.
Moreover, FL can train a Multi-Agent Reinforcement
Learning (MARL)-based framework for constructing
channel encryption and decryption, ensuring transmission reliability in 6G networks [199]. Entities of the
metaverse (avatars and digital twins) should be modeled
using hybrid models. To accurately imitate the behaviors
of these entities in the virtual space, a combination
of machine learning models, mathematical models,
and experimental models should be used. The users’
avatars should be modeled by personalized, distributed
learning-based approaches. Obtaining a global model
for the avatars would not accurately represent users
uniquely; this entails the use of personalized modeling.
As it is not always feasible to build a personalized model,
clustering can be used to facilitate modeling. Clustering
groups similar devices together and creates a global
model; the model output is trained to create a local
model for the avatar/device [99].
The future metaverse will be built on shared hardware and dynamic resource allocation for optimal
performance. AI-powered edge computing and adaptive infrastructure will ensure frictionless access to
computing resources. This will lead to cost-effective
meta spaces where users pay as per their usage of
the resources. As a result, scalability and sustainability
will improve, facilitating easier widespread adoption
of metaverse [173]. Metaverse connectivity will be
revolutionized by zero-touch networking and AI-driven
automation. They will automatically redistribute networking resources in real time to deliver low latency
and high efficiency. Removal of manual network
configuration will result in self-healing, self-optimizing
infrastructure. It will be capable of supporting millions
of concurrent users, making metaverse experiences just
as seamless and dependable [285]. FL-based network
slicing will allow for efficient wireless network resource
allocation by optimizing the utilization of bandwidth.
Different IoT applications within the metaverse will
share network resources dynamically without compromising on high Quality of Service (QoS). This
will lead to increased scalability, allowing industries
such as smart cities and automated factories to benefit
from metaverse connectivity. The metaverse-enabling
IoT applications will thereby be made more efficient and cost-effective [286]. Federated Learning and
MARL-based security systems will enhance metaverse
communications through autonomous encryption and
decryption processes. These systems will ensure secure
transmission in 6G networks while adapting to realtime threats. AI-based decision-making will allow
self-learning security models to respond to cyber
threats dynamically. This will provide enhanced privacy,
secure transactions, and protected user interactions in
virtual environments [287]. Hybrid modeling methods
are likely to make avatars and digital twins in the
metaverse more accurate and realistic. Through the
integration of machine learning, mathematical modeling, and empirical simulation, these digital entities
are likely to exhibit behavior closer to their physical
equivalents. This development will be especially crucial
for virtual training, gaming, and business simulation
industries. The increased realism will enable a more
immersive and data-driven metaverse [288]. The future
metaverse will utilize personalized, distributed learning
models to create avatars that reflect individual users
in a realistic manner. Unlike typical models, these
avatars will adapt to user behavior, preferences, and
interactions over time and change accordingly. This
will increase engagement and digital identity security,
rendering avatars more realistic. The development of
adaptive AI-driven digital identities will revolutionize
the manner in which users interact with the metaverse
[289]. Clustering-based learning will enable efficient
and scalable avatar modeling through the clustering of
comparable devices and users. The process will build
general models, which will later be customized for
personal users to avoid extensive computation. This
will be personalized without excessive computations,
which will render the metaverse scalable. By virtue of
balancing local customization vs. shared learning, the
strategy will optimize AI-powered avatar experiences to
the maximum extent [290].
3) Wearable technologies for immersive metaverse space.
Future work in the realm of wearable technologies for immersive metaverse spaces will focus on
advancing the development of printed, flexible, and
lightweight devices that prioritize conformability, comfort, and enhanced sensing capabilities such as haptic feedback [291]. This entails further exploration
into novel materials and manufacturing techniques to
achieve seamless integration with the user’s physiology, enabling comprehensive tracking of physiological
parameters and enhancing the multi-sensory experience.
Additionally, research efforts should aim to optimize
cost-effectiveness to ensure broader accessibility, thus
facilitating the widespread adoption of metaverse experiences. Collaborative endeavors between academia,
industry, and healthcare practitioners will be crucial in
realizing the potential of metaverse wearables for applications in immersive digital healthcare, as discussed
in [292].
The most recent advancement in wearable technology,
particularly for the metaverse, is focused on creating
printed, flexible, and light technologies for enhanced
user comfort and functionality. Soft material advances,
such as liquid metals and bioresorbable materials,
are enabling devices conforming to the human body
for enhanced interaction and inconspicuous monitoring
in virtual environments. Printing technologies have
emerged as a major method of developing customizable, stretchable devices that are compatible with
new materials, extending beyond the limitations of
traditional fabrication techniques. These innovations are
expanding the potential applications of wearable devices
in the metaverse, from virtual reality experiences to
health monitoring, and bridging the gap between the
physical and virtual worlds. [293]. Haptic feedback
will be further developed to provide natural touch
sensations in the metaverse using electrotactile stimulation, ultrasonic sound, and soft actuators. Such systems
will provide users with force, vibration, and texture
sensing, resulting in natural virtual experiences. This
will be especially valuable in gaming, remote work, and
virtual training, where touch feedback enhances realism.
As such, metaverse interactions will become more
natural, bridging the physical and digital experience
gap [294]. The combination of multi-sensory feedback
will enhance metaverse wearables, combining haptic,
auditory, visual, and even olfactory experiences. AIpowered sensor fusion will advance situational awareness and emotional presence, adapting to user needs
in the moment. This will enable hyper-immersive environments for applications like mental health therapy,
virtual education, and virtual tourism. Users will not
merely see and hear virtual worlds but also feel and
interact with them in ways never before possible [295].
The advancement of digital 3D fashion and virtual
garment production is driving cost-effective and scalable
manufacturing in the metaverse. By leveraging digital
modeling software and virtual textile libraries, brands
can reduce material waste and eliminate the need for
physical prototypes, significantly lowering production
costs. The adoption of photorealistic 3D rendering
enhances marketing strategies, allowing fashion brands
to showcase designs without traditional photoshoots or
sample production. Additionally, digital garments can
be seamlessly transferred across different metaverse
platforms, improving accessibility and encouraging
widespread adoption. This shift towards digital fashion
democratizes access to high-quality virtual wearables,
making them more affordable and sustainable [296]. The
integration of wearables with the physiology of users
in the metaverse is being enhanced by the development
of hybrid sensor technologies. Physical, biochemical,
and multimodal sensors are being utilized in these
wearables to provide real-time and non-invasive monitoring of physiological signals such as heart rate, body
temperature, and electrophysiological activity such as
EEG and ECG. Wearable sensors with microfluidics
integrated can provide real-time biofluid analysis along
with the measurement of biochemical markers in sweat,
saliva, and interstitial fluid. However, system-level
performance limitations, power consumption issues, and
environmental noise are challenges to be addressed
to enable smooth functioning to be maintained. With
the help of sophisticated data analytics and machine
learning techniques, these wearables are able to improve
signal understanding and adapt to changing virtual
worlds, resulting in a more engaging and responsive
metaverse experience [297].
4) Future Perspectives on Quantum Integration in the
Metaverse. Recent advancements in quantum technologies have opened transformative avenues for metaverse
applications, promising to overcome the limitations of
classical systems in terms of computational power, data
security, and network performance. As quantum computing evolves from the current noisy intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) era toward fault-tolerant quantum
computing (FTQC), its ability to perform parallel
computations using superposition and entanglement
is expected to address the significant processing
bottlenecks inherent in large-scale, immersive virtual
environments [298].
A key advantage of quantum integration is its potential
to redefine security in the metaverse. Classical cryptographic methods, which secure today’s digital interactions, face significant threats from quantum algorithms
such as Shor’s and Grover’s. In response, researchers are
developing quantum-resistant cryptographic schemes
and exploring quantum-enabled blockchain systems
that leverage quantum mechanical properties to secure
data exchanges [299]. For instance, quantum key
distribution (QKD) offers a fundamentally secure
method for establishing encryption keys, ensuring that
any eavesdropping attempt can be detected, thereby
safeguarding sensitive user interactions and digital asset
transactions within the metaverse [300]. Furthermore,
emerging approaches such as quantum blind signatures
and hybrid quantum-classical cryptography are under
investigation to fortify authentication protocols, ensuring robust protection against both classical and quantum
attacks [301], [302].
The computational prowess of quantum systems
also promises to revolutionize the way metaverse
environments are rendered and managed. Quantum
algorithms can tackle complex optimization problems
more efficiently than classical methods, significantly
enhancing real-time rendering, dynamic simulation, and
large-scale data processing [177]. Quantum machine
learning (QML) is particularly promising; by exploiting
quantum parallelism, QML can accelerate tasks such
as natural language processing, image recognition, and
pattern detection, which are critical for applications like
real-time avatar rendering and interactive virtual experiences [303], [304]. These capabilities are expected
to enable the creation of more responsive, adaptive,
and realistic digital environments that can seamlessly
integrate multi-sensory data.
Another pivotal aspect of quantum integration is the
evolution of network architectures. The development of
a quantum internet—where quantum states are transmitted via entanglement and quantum teleportation—offers
the potential for ultra-low latency and highly secure data
transmission. This new network paradigm could serve as
the backbone for next-generation metaverse platforms,
enabling robust connectivity and rapid information
exchange across globally distributed nodes [305]. Key
to this vision is the deployment of scalable quantum
repeaters and sophisticated error-correction techniques,
which are critical for maintaining entanglement over
long distances and ensuring the reliability of quantum
communication channels [306], [307].
Moreover, bridging the gap between quantum and
classical systems is essential for practical implementation. Middleware solutions, such as the CUDA
quantum platform and XACC, are emerging as promising frameworks that facilitate hybrid computation
models. These platforms enable seamless integration
between quantum processing units (QPUs) and classical
high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures,
ensuring that metaverse applications can fully leverage
quantum advantages while maintaining compatibility
with existing systems [308], [309].
Looking ahead, interdisciplinary research must address
several critical challenges: stabilizing quantum states
over extended distances, optimizing quantum algorithms for metaverse-specific tasks, and developing
cost-effective quantum-classical middleware solutions.
Overcoming these hurdles will not only enhance the
computational efficiency and security of metaverse
platforms but will also pave the way for innovative
applications that harness the unique capabilities of
quantum technologies [300].
In summary, the integration of quantum technologies
into the metaverse represents a paradigm shift with
the potential to radically redefine digital interaction. By combining quantum-enhanced computation,
secure quantum communication, and quantum-enabled
blockchain, future metaverse platforms can achieve
unprecedented levels of efficiency, security, and immersive interactivity. As these quantum systems mature and
interdisciplinary efforts intensify, the convergence of
classical and quantum paradigms will likely herald a
new era of digital transformation, ultimately enabling
a more resilient and innovative metaverse experience.
VI. CONCLUSION
The potential of the metaverse, a comprehensive, immersive
realm enabled by multi-technology integration, offers revolutionary prospects for societal interaction and transformation.
Nevertheless, these possibilities are accompanied by signif
icant challenges that need attention. This paper has highlighted the critical role of 6G, with its advanced capabilities
in URLLC and EMBB, in driving the metaverse forward.
Central to the discourse are the demands of the metaverse,
such as data rate and latency requirements and the integration
of augmented, virtual, and mixed reality technologies. These
components are paramount to ensuring a satisfactory QoS and
QoE. Additionally, we have discussed how edge computing
and blockchain can provide benefits to the metaverse while
noting the challenges that lie within their integration. Semantic communication and edge learning emerged as significant
players in meeting minimum requirements and optimizing
the metaverse ecosystem. Furthermore, we also reviewed
the latest assistant technology that uses LLM and how such
models could be used as chatbots for users in the metaverse.
Additionally, we discussed the advantages of LLM for other
applications such as semantic communication. We explored
how LLM could summarize and recreate texts in conjunction
with semantic communication. However, their application
raises issues of scalability, privacy, and interoperability. The
interplay of the metaverse, semantic communication, and
edge computing presents a dynamic synergy, especially in
the creation of digital twins, resource allocation, and in
establishing a secure, real-time processing and analytics
system. The broader social and ethical implications of
the metaverse should not be overlooked. Issues of the
digital divide, content moderation, and data ownership pose
challenges to equitable access and responsible use of the
metaverse. As we look to the future, continuous research is
required to overcome these challenges, with a particular focus
on innovative applications and infrastructure development.
The potential application of quantum computing, with its
advanced AI capabilities and complex problem-solving,
presents new avenues to explore. In conclusion, while the
metaverse holds transformative potential, it is imperative to
address the inherent challenges to maximize its benefits and
ensure a sustainable and inclusive digital future.
