nature of blockchain as a broadcast transmission technology from the perspective of technology evolution and
analyzes the necessity of building a blockchain-based public Information Technology (IT) system. In addition,
this paper analyzes the architecture, characteristics, and applications regarding trusted public IT system
construction by drawing on the design ideas and architecture of Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN).
Key words:  Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN); broadcast transmission protocols; public Information
Technology (IT) systems
1 Introduction
Blockchain[1–4]
is one of the most influential
technologies in the new round of digital economy
development. However, there are many different views
on blockchain in academia and industry. Some
researchers think blockchain is a shared ledger[5, 6] or a
new database technology[7, 8]
. However, others believe
it is a data tracing technology[9–11] or a digital
currency[12, 13]
. These definitions mentioned above
show the extension of the concept of blockchain
technology, which only reflects its technical
characteristics and application scenarios. To
understand the essence of blockchain, we shall step out
of the concept and review the development process of
information technology.
In human history, every round of information
revolution has been achieved by changing the ways of
information transmission to improve communication
efficiency. The invention of the telephone in 1876 led
to a qualitative leap in information exchange, which
broke through the limitations of time and space for
communication between people. However, at early
stage, telephones could only support two-way calls and
could not meet the needs of multi-person
communication. Worse still, this linear mode of
information transmission had low efficiency and was
prone to errors during communication. With the
development of technology, teleconference systems
that support multi-person calls have emerged. From the
perspective of information dissemination,
teleconferences have changed the original linear mode
of information transmission into the broadcast mode,
which entirely updates the way of information
exchange. In 1946, the first computer appeared,
followed by the birth of the Internet in the 1970s, also
known as the World Wide Web[14]
, which triggered a
technology and information revolution and ushered in a
new era of human civilization. However, the Internet
comprises networks connected by individual
computers, and its information exchange way is still
essentially a linear mode of pairwise transmission.
Let us compare the Internet and blockchain
technology with telephones and teleconferences. The
great thing about blockchain technology is that it
simulates a broadcast transmission mode based on the
existing hardware of the Internet, which allows
multiple Information Technology (IT) systems to
conduct teleconferences and form networks where
information can be transmitted and exchanged in all
directions. As a result, blockchain users can reach
consensus faster and more efficiently. This type of
broadcast transmission is an evolution of the Internet
and an upgrade in the way of information
dissemination, which must meet three principles at the
same time: first, the data are transmitted to other
people in a broadcast manner; second, the feedback of
any data recipient will be broadcast to everyone in the
network; third, everyone in the network must
simultaneously know that others are receiving the same
data. It is easy to see that the broadcast communication
mode has the advantages of higher information
transmission efficiency, more transparency,
decentralization, security, and credibility. In general,
the essence of blockchain technology is a
decentralized, distributed, open, and transparent
information system that utilizes broadcast transmission
methods to co-govern the data in terms of structure,
traceability, authority, and verification based on
consensus.
This paper profoundly explores the nature of
blockchain as a broadcast transmission technology
from the perspective of technological evolution,
analyzes the shortcomings of the existing Internet, and
proposes the necessity of building a public IT system
based on blockchain. Furthermore, based on the design
concept and technical system of Blockchain-based
Service Network (BSN) in practice, this paper
expounds the fundamental technical architecture,
necessary characteristics, and practical applications
involved in building a trusted public IT system, which
draws a blueprint for the coexistence of public and
private domains for the future Internet.
2 Development Trend of Information
Systems
In the early days of the Internet, interconnection and
sharing were its core concepts[15]
. The Internet’s
original intention was to facilitate information
transmission between individuals. Everyone can share
their own information, which others can access and
utilize. However, with the rapid development of the
Internet, some large corporations have risen and begun
to control the direction of its development, leading to a
trend towards centralization[16]
. There are two reasons
behind this centralization trend, i.e., technical and
commercial factors. Managing and distributing data has
become increasingly difficult due to the increasing
amount of information on the Internet and the
complexity of technology. Therefore, centralized
institutions are necessary for managing and accrediting
the data, which ensures that data can be distributed and
utilized efficiently. Commercial factors have also
contributed to the centralization of the Internet. Large
corporations monopolize markets and control user data
to gain profits, further strengthening the centralization
trend of the Internet. As a result, the concept of
interconnection and sharing gradually faded on the
Internet, and privatization became the mainstream.
However, privatization leads to various problems,
making it imperative to create public IT systems.
2.1 Problems of private information systems
Because the vast majority of data on the Internet are
stored in the databases of large companies, the Internet
can be considered as a private system from the
perspective of data acquisition and storage. Aiming to
gain business benefits, these companies possess
massive amounts of user data and utilize it for
commercial purposes through various algorithms and
analysis techniques. Undeniably, by ceding data rights,
users can enjoy the convenience of the Internet as
better digital services and products can be accessed
more efficiently. Meanwhile, these large companies
that control the data can also expand their scales and
achieve rapid growth. This model has reached an
equilibrium within a certain period, resulting in the
vigorous development of the Internet economy over the
past decade or so. However, when large companies
continuously try to seize more data rights from users
and repeatedly break the boundaries of equilibrium to
meet their reckless growth needs, the drawbacks of the
privatized Internet become more apparent.
Firstly, on the privatized Internet, because data are
controlled and monopolized by a few large companies,
data transparency is severely compromised where data
sources, processing methods, and usage purposes are
non-transparent. Users cannot know the source and
collection methods of the data, making it difficult to
judge its authenticity and accuracy. They cannot
understand the algorithms and methods used to process
the data, which makes it hard to judge the objectivity
and impartiality of the results. Worse still, users cannot
know what the data is used for, so it is not easy to
know whether it infringes upon their legitimate rights
and interests.
Secondly, on the privatized Internet, all data are
stored by large companies and used for advertising and
other commercial purposes without users’ full
knowledge and consent, violating user privacy and
rights. Moreover, the unclear data ownership brings up
many policy, legal, and technical issues, such as how to
ensure data security and reliability, who should be
responsible for data security, and under what
circumstances personal data can be collected, stored,
and used.
Thirdly, on the privatized Internet, the large
companies, which control the vast majority of user data
and algorithms, are unwilling to share, making it
difficult for other institutions and individuals to obtain
similar data resources. The restriction on data openness
and interoperability affects the Internet’s openness and
hinders its innovation and further development.
Fourthly, on the privatized Internet, all data are
stored in the back-end databases of a few large
companies, which will be controlled and restricted by a
single entity permanently. Once these companies go
bankrupt or dissolve, users face the risk of data loss or
damage.
2.2 Advantages of public IT systems
In order to solve the problems of the privatized
Internet, this paper argues that a new way of building
IT systems and applications will emerge. Compared
with the current mainstream private IT systems
controlled by a single entity or company, the new IT
systems will be deployed in a public environment and
managed by multiple users with equal rights. This
information system can be called a “public IT system”.
Specifically, the public IT system exchanges and
shares data in a distributed public environment based
on distributed cloud and blockchain technology. It does
not rely on a single company’s private servers and
databases. Under this construction mode, multiple
users can jointly manage IT systems and applications
with equal data rights. Without data monopoly, the
system is more open and transparent. Compared with
private information systems, the advantages of public
IT systems are as follows:
(1) Data are sharable and open in public IT systems,
and data transparency is improved. All users can access
and use the same data with equal rights. The public can
scrutinize and evaluate the data quality and data
authenticity, which helps distributed systems
continuously evolve towards trusted networks and
trusted systems.
(2) Data can be transferred more efficiently between
multiple applications and systems since they are shared
and exchanged in a public environment. Moreover,
data interoperability is improved, which makes it more
convenient for users to use and manage.
(3) In public IT systems, multiple users can manage
and control IT systems and applications
collaboratively. There is no single entity or company
monopolizing data, which protects users’ data
ownership and use rights.
(4) Data can be stored longer in public IT systems.
Since a single entity does not control user data, it will
not be affected by the company collapse or dissolution.
Public IT systems represent a new way of building
information systems and applications. They are
expected to develop into a mainstream trend, bringing
users more openness, transparency, security, and
efficiency. Users can establish personal databases on
public IT systems, use private keys to manage their
data, and decide whether to allow other IT systems to
access and invoke the data. Using technologies such as
privacy computing, users can better protect their data
privacy and security, helping avoid data abuse and
leakage by those companies. This type of personal
database is usually built on a public network with many
users so that personal data cannot be destroyed and
deleted by a few companies or entities. Meanwhile,
with the evolution of business and technology, all
countries will promote relevant laws and regulations
for public IT systems to regulate industry development
in the future.
2.3 Two-layer structure of the future internet
Although private IT systems have some problems, they
still have advantages, such as better customizability,
security, and stability. They can better meet the
specific needs of enterprises or institutions. Therefore,
enterprises will still use private IT systems and
applications in the future. On the contrary, IT systems
and applications built in the public environment have
better transparency and interoperability, which can
better serve public interests. Therefore, more public IT
systems and applications will likely appear. For
example, Metaverse, Web3, and other novel
applications will be constructed on public IT systems.
As a result, the future Internet will be divided into
private and public domains. In order to achieve higherquality services, some data and applications will be
stored in a private environment, and the others will be
saved in a public environment according to different
business needs.
The coexistence of public and private domains can
bring many benefits. Data can be more easily obtained,
understood, and validated, and its quality, reliability,
and value will be improved. Meanwhile, when data
become more ubiquitous as public resources, people
will obtain more opportunities to use them, which can
encourage innovation and improve the quality of
products and services. Better still, the coexistence of
public and private domains can also promote fairness
and openness, encouraging more people to participate
in and contribute to socio-economic development.
Therefore, the future Internet will also be divided
into two layers (as shown in Fig. 1). The first layer is
the current Internet, also called the private layer. It
serves the private IT systems currently dominant
worldwide and controlled by a minority of Internet
companies. The second layer is the new public layer of
the Internet, serving the public IT systems. As
technology gradually matures, applications with high
requirements for data transparency, interoperability,
ownership, and sustainability will migrate to the public
layer of the Internet.
The two-layer structure will also change the design
logic of information systems. Based on blockchain and
distributed technology, public IT systems can be built
in a public environment in the future, which will be
owned, shared, and co-governed by multiple parties
with equal rights. All data and operations in public IT
systems are transparent. Users can manage their data
through private keys and genuinely have control and
ownership of personal data. With the popularity of
distributed technology applications and public IT
systems’ emergence and rapid development, the
number of open and transparent distributed networks
will increase. The emergence of new technologies,
such as distributed identity and authentication,
network-wide distributed Domain Name System
(DNS), and distributed cloud technology, will connect
all these public distributed networks to form a new
layer on the top of the Internet.
3 Construction Mechanism of BSN
3.1 Concepts
BSN[17]
is the world’s largest and world-leading
blockchain infrastructure platform developed and
owned by China. Based on blockchain technology,
BSN provides distributed cloud infrastructures to help
traditional cloud service providers, data centers, and
enterprises build a dedicated or joinable public
distributed information network, where blockchain is
used as an operating system to manage various
distributed applications, systems, and cloud resources.
From the beginning of its design, BSN was
developed based on the aim of building distributed
cloud infrastructure[18]
. By providing distributed cloud
management software, BSN can establish distributed
cloud environments (also known as the BSN private
network) parallel to traditional cloud environments in
any private or public cloud. Meanwhile, BSN has
launched distributed cloud service networks (also
known as the BSN public network), where enterprises
and individuals can set up their own data centers to join
the network and freely build and manage their
distributed applications. Similar to the Internet, all
BSN virtual and physical data centers and cloud
environments are connected through communication
protocols to form a global BSN network.
3.2 Design ideas
The design ideas of BSN can be summarized as “one
core, two directions, six services, and seven
principles”.
3.2.1 One core: Serving digital development
BSN gives full play to the role of blockchain in
promoting data sharing, optimizing business processes,
reducing operating costs, improving collaboration
efficiency, and building a trustworthy system. BSN
effectively reduces blockchain deployment and
operation costs by providing a one-stop blockchain
operating environment and node-refined computing,
storage, and networking services. Moreover, through
intelligent gateways and prefabricated chain code
mechanisms, BSN effectively reduces the technical
threshold of blockchain application development. BSN
uses blockchain technology to promote larger-scale
interconnection among data, information, funds,
talents, and credit information. It ensures the orderly
and efficient flow of production factors within the
region, promoting the development of the digital
economy, smart city, and digital government.
3.2.2 Two directions: Co-management and cogovernance
Instead of being controlled by a specific individual or
company, the service networks are jointly managed by
the BSN alliance to ensure the orderly operation of the
service networks and build a sustainable network
development ecosystem.
3.2.3 Six services: Multi-cloud services, multiportals, multi-frameworks, multi-networks,
multi-regions, and multi-agencies
The six service capabilities of BSN are as follows:
● Multi-cloud services: Users can freely deploy
applications using the resources of any cloud service
provider and can even deploy multiple nodes of an
application on data centers possessed by different cloud
service providers.
● Multiple portals: Different users can join the
identical open permissioned blockchain from different
portals.
● Multi-frameworks: BSN can perform cross-chain
data interoperation between different frameworks by
formulating unified blockchain framework adaptation
standards.
● Multi-networks: As a public infrastructure, BSN
supports free access by users on any public network.
● Multi-regions: BSN is deployed globally as a
public infrastructure, allowing applications to be
deployed in different regions as needed.
● Multi-agencies: As a public infrastructure, BSN
supports multi-agency access and business
collaboration.
3.2.4 Seven principles: Autonomy, publicness,
scalability, open source, multi-portals, low
cost, and security
The seven principles followed by BSN includes:
● Autonomy: BSN is a public infrastructure that
China’s organization independently develops and
controls network access rights. It realizes unified
management and adaptation of multiple frameworks,
and implements componentized cross-chain
technology, distributed storage technology, and
integrated development environment. BSN has created
a fully functional blockchain-integrated ecosystem,
including chain construction, utilization, expansion,
cross-chain, and management.
● Publicness: Instead of an utterly commercial
project, the research, design, construction, and
operation of BSN are based on the idea of building a
public infrastructure. BSN connects data center
resources through blockchain development
environments and protocols, and supports national and
industry standards regarding encryption algorithms and
information security technology.
● Scalability: BSN allows all data centers and cloud
service resources that meet security and configuration
requirements to apply for and join the service
networks.
● Open source: BSN follows the blockchain open
source development concept. Data center software
codes must be open source, and the operating
mechanism must be transparent to everyone.
● Multi-portals: BSN adopts a multi-portal strategy
to avoid monopoly and exclusivity. Any cloud service
provider joining the network can build its service portal
to manage its developers and service products.
● Low cost: The most important purpose of BSN is
to reduce the cost of the deployment, operation,
maintenance, and supervision of blockchain
applications, which helps promote the popularity and
development of blockchain technology.
● Security: The construction of BSN strictly follows
the physical and network security requirements of level
3 or above specified in the relevant national
information security technology standards and ensures
the redundant deployment of key nodes to keep the
system’s availability.
3.3 Goals
BSN is aimed at a public infrastructure for distributed
technology applications and is committed to
continuously reducing the application costs, technical
thresholds, and supervision difficulties of distributed
technology. In terms of technology, BSN uses
blockchain as an operating system in a distributed
cloud environment and continues to promote the
construction of new distributed operating systems.
BSN provides a fertile ground for distributed
technology innovation and accelerates its popularity
and application by continuously breaking through
technical bottlenecks and comprehensively innovating
the cognition and application models. In terms of
application, BSN is committed to accelerating the
industrial integration of distributed technologies,
injecting new momentum into the digital
transformation. The applications of BSN strongly
support the development of China’s digital economy
and governance.
In the long run, as social needs change and
technology evolves, the traditional Internet will
inevitably be unable to meet users’ demands fully. The
emergence of public IT systems will integrate
distributed technology into the existing technology
systems. The public IT systems will become a global
exploration direction in the future. Therefore, the longterm goal of BSN is to establish a new public layer on
the Internet to provide services for various types of
distributed applications in diverse industries.
4 Application of BSN
4.1 Technical architecture of BSN
The construction of BSN is based on the mechanism
mentioned above, which consists of public city nodes,
technology platforms, service portals, and operation
and maintenance systems. The technical architecture is
shown in Fig. 2.
Public city nodes are the basic operating units of
BSN. Its primary function is to provide system
resources such as access control, transaction
processing, data storage, and data computation for
blockchain applications. The owner of each public city
node is a provider of cloud resources or data centers.
After the owners install the public city node software in
the cloud environments and complete the network
access process, a public city node on BSN can be built.
Then, the application publisher can retrieve the node in
the portal and purchase its resources for application
deployment.
The BSN technology platform can be regarded as the
operating system for blockchain applications. There are
a variety of blockchain frameworks around the world,
each of which has its consensus algorithms,
transmission mechanisms, and developer tools. BSN
has established framework adaptation standards to
ensure that each technology platform based on
permissioned blockchains should comply with a series
of standards, such as cryptography algorithms and
gateway Software Development Kits (SDKs), before
accessing BSN.
Similar to the Internet, BSN adopts a multi-portal
strategy. After joining BSN, enterprises with relevant
resources, such as cloud service providers or
technology platform owners, can apply to establish
service portals. The service portals can be a separate
Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) website or adding
BaaS functions on the existing cloud service portals.
Developers can purchase service network resources
within the service portals to publish and manage
blockchain applications.
The BSN operation and maintenance system is a
centralized scheduling and management system,
including functions of node management, application
management, billing management, Certificate
Authority (CA) management, and monitoring
management. After the cloud service providers add
cloud resources to BSN, the operation and maintenance
of the public city nodes are managed uniformly by
BSN, and cloud service providers only need to manage
the hardware and network. The system adopts a loose
coupling design model, ensuring blockchain
applications will not be affected when the system fails.
4.2 Service system of BSN
The services provided by BSN includes two major
systems: the private network and the public network
(as shown in Fig. 3). The BSN private network, also
known as the enterprise-level BSN distributed cloud
management platform, establishes a distributed cloud
environment based on blockchains and supports
deployment in various Internet Data Centers (IDCs),
public clouds, and private clouds. The BSN public
network consists of the BSN-DDC basic network and
the BSN Spartan network. The BSN-DDC basic
network is a public distributed cloud service network
with open permissioned blockchains oriented to the
domestic market. It provides free and open-source data
center services. In contrast, the BSN Spartan network
is a public distributed cloud service network composed
of non-cryptocurrency public blockchains oriented to
the overseas market. It provides free, open-source, and
anonymous data center services.
4.2.1 BSN private network
The BSN private network or the BSN distributed cloud
management platform, is a professional cloud
environment management software used to manage
distributed systems and blockchain applications.
Oriented to governments, enterprises, and institutions,
the BSN private network deploys a private distributed
network environment based on the BSN technology
within their existing public clouds, private clouds, or
Local Area Networks (LANs). This environment
parallels traditional cloud management environments
that only support centralized applications. Using
multiple blockchain frameworks as the operating
system, the platform can perform fully automated
billing, operation, and maintenance across the cloud
resources, systems, nodes, applications, and BaaS
layers.
4.2.2 BSN public network
The BSN public network includes the BSN-DDC
network for domestic users and the BSN Spartan
network for overseas users.
The BSN-DDC network is a public distributed cloud
service network jointly built by the BSN development
alliance with professional companies providing
blockchain technology services. Oriented to the
domestic market, the BSN-DDC network integrates
multiple open permissioned blockchains as operating
systems to develop and operate distributed
applications. It provides essential infrastructure for
developing and applying technologies such as
blockchain and Non-Fungible Token (NFT).
The BSN Spartan network is a public infrastructure
network based on the lightweight BSN Spartan data
center software, which is open source, free, and
anonymous for anyone to install. Within the data
center, the nodes of several non-cryptocurrency public
blockchains can be installed and accessed. By
removing the cryptocurrencies from the public
blockchain layer, the BSN Spartan network provides
non-cryptocurrency public blockchain services to all IT
systems worldwide to develop applications based on
this public IT system infrastructure effectively.
4.3 Technical characteristics
BSN has unified the adaptation and management of the
core blockchain technology, providing users with
large-scale distributed cloud environments to build and
run various distributed applications.
4.3.1 Integration and adaptation of multiple
blockchain frameworks
The compatibility and diversity of technology are the
primary concerns of BSN. BSN has added almost all
mainstream blockchain frameworks globally into the
system, capable of adapting and managing dozens of
open-source and commercial blockchain frameworks.
BSN has formed an optimal practice standard for
blockchain framework management.
4.3.2 Orchestration and scheduling of
heterogeneous cloud resources
BSN can achieve lifecycle management of blockchain
operating environment resources based on mainstream
OpenStack and Kubernetes cluster technologies, and
realizes automatic resource allocation, scaling
orchestration, load optimization, monitoring analysis,
and operation maintenance based on various
heterogeneous clouds. BSN can unify almost all
mainstream cloud resources into a virtual environment
management system with the capability of automatic
management and deployment.
4.3.3 Cross-chain communication between
homogeneous and heterogeneous blockchains
With the widespread application of blockchain
technology, the need for data sharing between different
blockchain applications is becoming increasingly
urgent. BSN implements cross-chain communication
based on the relay chain cross-chain mechanism and
meets the requirements for information validity,
security, and transaction in the cross-chain
communication process. BSN supports cross-chain
transaction management and processing of multiple
homogeneous and heterogeneous blockchains within
and without the platform. In addition, BSN supports
unified chain identity (ID), Relayer management,
automatic deployment, and cross-chain contract
management.
4.3.4 Extensible Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
system
BSN supports various encryption algorithms. When
communication authentication, transaction processing,
and application access are required, BSN provides
services of CA issuance, update, discard, and
verification functions for the blockchain networks
within the platform. The trusted interconnection of
various blockchain applications is realized through the
root key issued by the national authority and crosschain technology.
4.4 Applications
BSN has been widely recognized. Its technical mode
and development concept have been included in the
“14th Five-Year Plan” and “New Infrastructure Plan”
for many provinces (such as Yunnan, Hainan, etc.) and
cities (such as Hangzhou, Wuhan, etc.). BSN has built
many benchmark projects for the industry based on the
BSN private network and achieved remarkable
application effects. BSN has deployed private networks
in 13 provinces (including Heilongjiang, Guandong,
etc.) and cities (including Changsha, Ningbo, etc.). The
networks provide reliable blockchain public service
capabilities for the digital economy development of
various provinces and cities. In addition, based on BSN
technology and facilities, China’s first cross-border
trade blockchain private network between Shenzhen
and Singapore was officially completed and
implemented in September 2021 under the cooperation
of Government Services and Data Management
Bureau, Commerce Bureau of Shenzhen Municipality,
and Singapore Infocomm Media Development
Authority (IMDA). Based on the single window
business of Shenzhen South Electronic Portal, BSN
technology is used to build a fundamental
infrastructure network for cross-border data encryption,
storage, transmission, and mutual recognition between
Shenzhen and Singapore. It ensures that the crossborder trade data between Shenzhen and Singapore can
be securely encrypted, managed, monitored,
authorized, and transmitted, effectively improving the
facilitation of cross-border trade. In the future, this
model can be replicated in other ports in China and
trade scenarios between different countries.
Furthermore, flexible application networking among
data centers will be available.
The BSN-DDC network is currently compatible with
multiple open permissioned blockchains, including
Tai’an Chain, Zunyi Chain, Jiuquan Chain, etc., which
provides extremely low-cost blockchain services for
enterprises, individuals, and organizations. Its
application scenarios cover various fields such as
government affairs, culture and tourism, finance,
manufacturing, agriculture, commerce, etc. Since its
release on January 25, 2022, the BSN-DDC network
business has been developing rapidly. Over 1500
platforms and enterprises have registered on the BSNDDC network and created over 32 million accounts,
generating nearly 5 million official Distributed Digital
Certificates (DDCs) and over 30 million NFTs. The
daily transaction volume of the entire network remains
stable at about 1 million units. In 2022, the total
number of transactions on the chain exceeded 150
million times, with more than 13.5 billion requests for
DDC official gateways. On June 29, 2022, the BSNDDC network ushered in a milestone moment. For the
first time since its official operation, the daily
transaction number of the production environment
applications on a single day exceeded Ethereum. On
that day, the daily transaction volume of the BSN-DDC
network reached 974 517 times, while the daily
transaction volume of Ethereum was 938 166 times. In
addition, BSN has laid out 56 regional data centers of
the BSN-DDC network nationwide to serve nearly
2000 blockchain application enterprises. There are over
35 million users and over 1 million active blockchain
transactions daily.
In September 2022, the BSN spartan network for the
international market was officially launched,
supporting enterprises in traditional fields to apply
blockchain technology without using virtual currencies.
BSN supports one-way cross-chain from the domestic
BSN-DDC network to the foreign Spartan network.
Cross-chain technology based on BSN can promote the
export of Chinese artists’ works overseas. For example,
the works of Chinese artists can be encapsulated as
NFTs and published on OpenSea. Saudi Aramco, the
world’s largest oil production company, has utilized
the BSN cloud management platform to carry out
supply chain management in Saudi Arabia. The
integration of information, funds, and logistics is
achieved by uploading data to the blockchain,
including supply chain data from upstream and
downstream enterprises, third-party warehousing and
logistics, etc. The efficiency of supply chain
management is highly improved. Hong Kong and
Shang Hai Banking Corporation (HSBC) has used BSN
to establish a B2B payment network to handle the
issues of virtual currency risks, transaction data
integrity, and transparency. Other issues encountered
when using blockchain technology in payment and
settlement, trade finance, and supply chain can also be
solved. It improves the efficiency and security of the
payment process. In addition, the governments of the
United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Bahrain, and other
countries have used BSN to promote applications such
as digital identity authentication and medical
information sharing.
BSN uses blockchain technology to empower the
development of China’s digital economy and provides
experience for the practice of blockchain applications.
BSN is committed to formulating standards and
technical specifications in the blockchain domain. In
2022, BSN participated in the drafting of essential
industry standards four times, and submitted seven
technology patents and 18 software copyrights, which
has set a benchmark for the development of blockchain
technology.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we have analyzed blockchain’s essence
from the broadcast transmission technology
perspective. As the existing Internet has apparent
shortcomings, it is necessary to construct a public IT
system based on blockchain. Therefore, We have
proposed the architecture, characteristics, and
applications regarding trusted public IT system
construction by drawing on the design ideas and
architectures of BSN.
In the future, with the development of the new public
layer of the Internet and public IT systems, a new
industry will emerge, which will bring great
opportunities for distributed operating systems and
databases. BSN will be committed to building a new
Internet public layer leading by China via continuously
upgrading the key technologies and standards, making
China the birthplace of the next round global
information revolution. We hope more partners will
join BSN to promote the globalization of Chinese
technology.
