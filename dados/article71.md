I. INTRODUCTION
The current industrial revolution, Industry 4.0, revolutionized
manufacturing and allied sectors by bringing disruptive technologies such as cognitive computing, artificial intelligence
(AI), cloud computing, and cyber-physical systems (CPS)
to the forefront of manufacturing. Industry 4.0 allowed the
machines to be intelligent, communicate with each other,
and do much of the production work in factories, giving us
the term “smart factories” [1]. “Mass personalization” is enabled by Industry 4.0, where customers can personalize the
products they want to purchase online through mass personalization techniques. Mass personalization is realized through
the Internet connectivity between the supply chains, robots
involved in the manufacturing process, dealership ordering
systems, and the customers [2]. While Industry 4.0 focused
on the connectivity of CPS, the upcoming Industry 5.0 revolves around the relationship between man and machine.
Industry 5.0 promises to integrate the creativity of humans
with the precision of robots. The machinery enabled by digital technologies combined with human cognitive intelligence
is expected to increase manufacturing speed and take it to
new levels of perfection. Industry 5.0 is expected to bring
humans back into the loop, where human experts will work
collaboratively with machines enabled by AI. In Industry 5.0,
the dangerous and repetitive tasks are automated, allowing
humans to concentrate on more creative jobs [3].
The metaverse is a perfect fit to bridge this gap in potential
Industry 5.0 applications requiring real-time decisions. The
metaverse has been in the limelight recently with the claims
from Microsoft and Facebook. The metaverse combines several technologies, such as video, augmented reality (AR),
and virtual reality (VR), where users can work, play with
friends, and stay connected with their friends virtually through
conferences, virtual trips, and concerts. The metaverse’s expansion will allow humans to co-exist in a hyper-real alternate
world [4]. Facebook invests heavily in this technology as it
envisions and foresees a virtual world in which digital avatars
are connected through entertainment, travel, or work using VR
headsets. Facebook believes that the metaverse could replace
the Internet. The metaverse is expected to make the Internet
medium more embodied and immersive, where people not just
look at the Internet but also experience it [5].
A. RECENT WORKS ON INDUSTRIAL METAVERSE
With its exciting features, the metaverse has immense potential to take the upcoming and futuristic Industry 5.0 to a
new level. In the metaverse, virtual replicas of the products
in manufacturing can be created in the digital world, where
experts can see the progress in manufacturing virtually as well
in medical for remote monitoring of patients and immersive
experience various smart city applications [6].
Due to the immense potential of Industry 5.0 and the metaverse in revolutionizing the industry and people’s lifestyles,
several researchers recently published surveys on both these
technologies. In [3], the authors considered some of the significant enabling technologies for Industry 5.0, such as the
IoT, AI, AR, VR, Big Data Analytics, Edge Computing, and
5G. The authors also presented various industry 5.0 applications such as healthcare, Supply Chain Management (SCM),
Smart Education, and Cloud Manufacturing. Another motivating study in [7] discussed key components of Industry 5.0
from a manufacturing perspective. The authors examined AI,
robotics, intelligent machines, IoT, and Big Data analytics as
significant elements of Industry 5.0in manufacturing. These
technologies can increase throughput, effectiveness, quality,
and cost reduction. Another interesting study in [8] discussed
how Industry 5.0 could impact education in engineering
courses. According to the authors, the current engineering curriculum is insufficient to prepare engineers for the challenges
of Industry 5.0. In another interesting study, the authors in [9]
presented a comprehensive survey on human-centric manufacturing in Industry 5.0. The authors highlight the importance
of humans in the manufacturing process. Machines can help
automate processes but cannot replace the human touch. Humans are still required to make decisions, solve problems, and
interact with customers. Human-centric manufacturing places
humans at the centre of manufacturing decision-making. On
the other hand, the study in [10] presented a comprehensive
survey on the factors that support a viable and functional
metaverse, along with regulatory and ethical concerns. The
authors discussed how advances in hardware performance,
such as faster CPUs and better graphics cards, allow users to
have more immersive experiences. The study in [5] presented
a detailed survey on the taxonomy, key components, potential
applications, and open challenges of the metaverse. Although
several researchers presented review papers on Industry 5.0
and the metaverse separately, very few reviews exist on the
fusion of these two exciting technologies. The above observations have motivated us to conduct this comprehensive review
of the metaverse applications for Industry 5.0.
The key contributions of the survey are:
1) The idea of integrating Industry 5.0 with the metaverse for more efficient interconnection and immersive environment for manufacturing processes has been
presented.
2) The key enabling technologies associated with integration and how these technologies can be organized to
provide a value-oriented industrial metaverse have been
highlighted.
3) The preliminary verticals of industry 5.0 and its integration with the metaverse and various applications have
been discussed for gaining better insights into various
issues in manufacturing units from different perspectives.
4) The industrial metaverse projects’ implementation perspective and application needs have been highlighted for
understanding the practical implications in the seamless
deployment of the industrial metaverse.
5) Various challenges in the adoption and implementation
perspective of the industrial metaverse have been highlighted, and suitable future directions for mitigating the
challenges were also suggested. This could enable the
policymakers to develop appropriate standards for interoperable design development.

II. PRELIMINARIES OF THE INDUSTRIAL METAVERSE
This section presents a brief overview of the metaverse and
enabling technologies of the industrial metaverse.
A. THE METAVERSE
Neil Stevenson coined the term “metaverse” in his 1992
novel Snow Crash [5]. However, it attracted huge attention
in October 2021, when Facebook officially changed its name
to Meta [11]. A fully functioning persistent metaverse does
not yet exist. However, the metaverse-like platforms such
as Roblox, Decentraland, Axie infinity, Illuvium, Sandbox
Fortnight, SecondLife, etc [12]. The metaverse is a shared
virtual environment for multiple users that combines physical
reality with the digital virtual world [13]. It is based on the
fusion of cutting-edge technologies that enable multidimensional interactions. Hence, the metaverse is a platform of
interconnected environments. It allows users to communicate
with each other in real-time and interact with digital artifacts.
The metaverse will significantly impact society, agriculture,
education, healthcare, and other sectors. AI, IoT, blockchain,
DTs, and AR will all be able to reach their full potential in
enabling the metaverse.
B. KEY ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES OF THE
INDUSTRIAL METAVERSE
The metaverse is a virtual world where users can socialize,
do business, and play video games. As more individuals participate, the metaverse’s popularity will grow exponentially.
In addition to Meta, Microsoft, Apple, and other technology
companies have begun investing in the metaverse. Cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and play-to-earn games attract new users.
Nevertheless, it is to be noted that the industrial metaverse
benefits as it can improve operational efficiency, transparency,
privacy, security, and trust between different industrial processes. Humans can co-exist in a hyper-real alternate world
in the metaverse with the help of technologies such as VR,
AR, AI and so on. A new era of interconnected industries
can be realized with the help of the metaverse, as there are
no barriers due to physical limitations. This section presents
the key enabling technologies to help realise the metaverse’s
potential in Industry 5.0.
1) VIRTUAL REALITY
VR is a 3D computer-rendered virtual environment. VR immerses individuals in surrounding scenes and objects as if
one of the scene’s characters appears to be real [14]. The
VR headset or helmet will be used to perceive the simulated
environment, allowing users to interact with the virtual objects
through user interaction techniques such as head tracking or
tangible controllers. Since it is separated from physical reality,
the users with the gadgets need to be more focused in the
virtual environment. The recent advancements in VR led to
the basis for the innovation of the metaverse. VR and the
metaverse are not the same. However, VR is an element of
the metaverse, which provides a virtual space for implanting
multiple users by enabling interactions simultaneously [15].
In Industry 5.0, the metaverse will deliver humans the best
virtual experiences. The metaverse, with the assistance of
VR will remove the barriers between reality and the virtual
world [16]. The metaverse will allow the user to personalize
the products using VR.
2) 3D MODELING
3D modelling creates a 3D representation of any object or
surface, which helps create 3D virtual environments. Every
physical element will have a digitized aspect to it. Converting
it into 3D elements will improve the essence of representing
the real world in a virtual environment [17]. The metaverse is
a shared virtual 3D interactive, immersive, and collaborative
environment. 3D modelling is a key component of the metaverse, which helps create 3D avatars and 3D spaces, enabling
users to perform operations in a virtual world. The metaverse
is dependent on 3D captures and visualization. Computing
devices need to understand the visual information of the user
activities and their surroundings, which helps build a realistic
3D Virtual environment in the metaverse. In Industry 5.0, VR
is essential to implement new methods to satisfy and understand customer needs and then into products and services.
The recent advancement in 3D modelling will help visualize the transformation of raw materials into finished goods.
The metaverse with modern technologies will lead to mass
customization of products by creating a relationship between
humans and machines in Industry 5.0 [18].
3) ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
Recently, several organizations started using AI for their business operations. AI is the ability of a computer or computercontrolled robots to perform tasks like humans [19]. Users can
use AI for decision-making or automation processes. AI will
assist the metaverse by including content analysis, supervised
speech processing, and computer vision [20]. AI also helps in
transforming the role of entities from the physical world to the
virtual environment automatically. AI-based methods, such as
machine learning(ML), deep learning, convolutional neural
networks, recurrent neural networks, reinforcement learning,
generative adversarial networks, stacked autoencoders, graph
neural networks, and meta-heuristic algorithms [21] provide a
basic foundation for Industry 5.0 that can help in understanding and enhancing the requirements by enabling the concepts
of Industry 5.0. AI algorithms are designed to learn from
human inputs. In these systems, the robots are trained on
datasets that are labelled and annotated by humans, allowing the robots to understand and interpret human needs and
generate accurate decisions based on the given input. Robots
equipped with AI can process real-time data by collecting
the data from different sensors and cameras, allowing them
to understand and adapt to new and unforeseen scenarios. AI
models enable robots to learn from their experiences. They try
different strategies and learn from the outcomes to understand
the most effective actions in new scenarios. Predictive maintenance is important in ensuring the reliability of robots in
human-centric settings. AI algorithms can predict equipment
failures or maintenance needs by analyzing data trends. This
proactive approach prevents downtime and ensures smoother
interactions.
4) AUGMENTED REALITY
AR technology provides an interactive experience of a realworld environment using computer-generated information.
Superimposing virtual objects into a real-world based on the
user’s perspective will enhance the effectiveness of the users’
interaction [22]. AR provides more realistic solutions by utilizing minimal hardware and provides a solid foundation for
developing the metaverse. AR object detection techniques will
help to build an efficient immersive 3D environment in the
metaverse. In Industry 5.0, the main focus is mass customization and ultra-personalization, which requires blending the
latest technologies like AR to establish collaboration between
cognitive systems, robots, and humans [8]. AR provides realtime data overlay, enabling workers to interact with robotic
systems effectively. AR also enables remote collaboration,
enabling experts to guide onsite employees remotely. The use
of AR simplifies the manufacturing process, making it more
adaptable and responsive to the needs of individual customers.
AR connects the virtual and physical worlds by overlaying
the data with the physical world. AR in Industry 5.0 will
guide the technicians or workers in machine maintenance i.e.,
performing service in real-time. Also, the digital management
of the workspace can be achieved by maintaining the harmony
between the business and manufacturing process.
5) BLOCKCHAIN
In 2008, Nakamoto Satoshi published a white paper that
served as the foundation for the blockchain concept. A
blockchain, also known as a distributed ledger, comprises a
series of connected blocks, each of which is linked to the
preceding one using the hash value of its header [23]. A block
also contains a timestamp, nonce, transaction data, and cryptographic hash. All nodes must agree to the same consensus
process to generate and validate new data blocks. The data exchange in the metaverse is greatly aided by using the advanced
encoding information system of the blockchain [24]. The privacy of sensitive information is protected by the blockchain’s
authentication, access control, and consensus methods [25].
Individuals and organizations can verify all transactions due
to the detailed audit trail provided by the blockchain. Industry
5.0, in association with blockchain, will effectively deliver
services with the help of the metaverse, where multiple parties
may be involved. The metaverse will safeguard the integrity
and transparency of information through the transactions in a
blockchain. This also ensures users’ data privacy in Industry
5.0. Furthermore, Blockchain can be added as a middleware
in industrial IoT to secure transactions among various entities. Various open architectures in utilizing blockchain as
a middleware in the Industry 5.0 scenario have been discussed in [26]. On the other hand, the metaverse will allow
users to interact with organizations virtually and allow them
to customize products [27]. The blockchain will protect this
sensitive data with its consensus mechanism, which will only
allow the modification of stored data based on the agreement
of all the participating nodes in the blockchain [28]. This
makes the data storage in Industry 5.0 resistant to attacks.
Man and machine collaboration requires secure data transfer
across various applications of Industry 5.0. The integration of
blockchain and the metaverse will enable Industry 5.0 and its
users to have data privacy for their shared information, trust
in the data stored, and reliability in data exchange.
6) 6G
6G is the sixth-generation standard for wireless communications technology currently being developed. It is the successor
to 5G and will be significantly faster. 6G networks will be
even more heterogeneous than their predecessors and support
VR/AR, real-time communications, ubiquitous intelligence,
and the IoT [29]. Networks and communications are integral
to everything from large-scale computation to enabling shared
experiences among people [30]. 6G is more heterogeneous
because it can work with diverse spectrum usage, technologies, devices, and applications. This is made possible by
advanced technologies like AI-driven network optimization
and advanced network slicing.
The metaverse will be greatly benefited by 6G networks.
6G has the advantages of speed, low latency, and low power
consumption [31]. This will help interconnect objects in the
real world with the metaverse. 6G will allow VR to reach
its full potential [32]. This will expand cooperation between
man and machine by connecting the physical and virtual
worlds, establishing the metaverse’s foundation. Numerous
applications within Industry 5.0 will transform due to 6G and
the metaverse integration. Through the use of cutting-edge
technologies like XR applications, the metaverse enables customers to do online shopping, professionals to attend meetings
in their desired avatar, and will also allow students to learn
about historical places virtually, with uninterruptible services
provided by 6G [33]. Integrating 6G and the metaverse will
enable Industry 5.0 and its users to use high-quality services
and experiences, parallel working capabilities, and latencyfree communications.
7) EDGE COMPUTING
Client-server communication is accelerated with the help of
edge computing, resulting in reduced latency and less bandwidth consumption [34]. Due to the distributed structure of
edge networks, it is difficult to attack. The rest will not be exposed if a breach occurs in a minor network section. The edge
computing architecture distributes processing tasks across the
network, making it more resilient than other centralized systems [35]. Edge computing will aid in better synchronization
of the physical world and the metaverse and efficient transmission of immersive virtual experiences in the metaverse [36].
Sensor data is critical in making real-time decisions, and edge
computing will contribute to it by supplying uninterrupted and
faster data services, allowing machines to function more efficiently in collaboration with humans [37]. In the metaverse,
edge computing will also ensure reliable resource allocation,
which will assist humans in making better decisions based on
the outcomes of AI models. Industry 5.0 will greatly benefit
from integrating the metaverse and edge computing.
8) DIGITAL TWINS
A Digital Twin(DT) is a digital representation of an entity or
system in the physical world. A DT consists of a virtual object
or model representing a real-world object, process, organization, person, or other abstraction [38]. In the metaverse, data
from various DTs is pooled for a holistic view of real-world
entities and their associated operations [39]. In Industry 5.0,
DTs are utilized by the maintenance sector to aid humans in
better understanding equipments, provide a thorough picture
of various parts or components and help in machine maintenance [40]. DTs can help identify the reason for inefficiency
and the physical solution to be incorporated into the real plant.
Also, DTs play a vital role in the system configuration phase
by validating the system in semi-physical simulation. This is
done by remote controlling and operating manufacturing systems. Furthermore, it enhances the fine-tuning of adjustment
instructions through live feedback to the physical system.
Also, humans will have the necessary information about the
machines in the metaverse with the help of DTs, allowing
them to make better decisions in Industry 5.0.
Leveraging the power of AI, blockchain, VR, AR, 3Dmodelling, digital twins and 6G with Edge computing in the
industrial metaverse environment would ensure a more immersive environment, and optimized rendering of data with
reduced latency by breaking the issues with virtual-physical
world connectivity, thereby assuring the more customized experience for the users. However, the implementation of digital
twin and AI tend to have higher costs. 6G provides superior
performance with respect to speed and latency, which makes
it crucial for real-time applications. Digital twins also require
real-time data processing, that relies on high-performance network capabilities.
C. RESEARCH GAPS AND MOTIVATION BEHIND THE
INTEGRATION OF THE METAVERSE WITH INDUSTRY 5.0
Industry 5.0 mainly concerns strengthening collaboration between humans and machines, there is a major research gap
in how the metaverse can enable the connection, particularly
among the manufacturing environment and other industries.
The potential of the metaverse to provide customized production through virtual customization by clients remains
unexplored. Virtual training in the metaverse faces several
challenges in enhancing the employee’s training in the relevant skills for Industry 5.0. Supply chain management also
requires more research on how a virtual environment enhances
transparency, efficiency, and collaboration [41]. Although numerous research has shown the necessity of digital twins
in Industry 5.0, the gap remains on how they meet predictive maintenance and operational efficiency through the
metaverse. The consideration of the security and privacy of
individual records and information is a concern that requires
more research. Integrating technologies within the metaverse
and Industry 5.0 applications requires more research on interoperable systems and standards. Environmental sustainability
and metaverse technologyâs impact are a research area that
requires more investigation. Additionally, there is a need for
more research on economic development and potential business models associated with the metaverse on Industry 5.0,
necessitating more study to understand how it will affect the
cost, revenue, and market structures.
Chen and Yong conducted a systematic review from 2006 to
2015 on how Industrial Information Integration Engineering
effectively adopts different perspectives of various domains
and usage of business process management, service-oriented
architectures, and applications in the enterprise system and
research opportunities [42]. The industrial metaverse can
automate the entire environment, including the full supply
chain, factory floors, production, retail, and physical assets,
by replicating it digitally for an efficient remote view [43].
The problems at the factory floor or retail store can be better
viewed without a physical presence.
One of the most important propositions of Industry 5.0,
namely resilience, is the ability of any system to recover faster
to a consistent state when a tremendous mishap is encountered [44]. This is a very important characteristic to be enforced by the metaverse environment as it is deeply connected
and more immersive; any disruption in a single point may lead
to contagious failure of tasks at various utilities. Therefore,
proper predictive mechanisms and steps for overcoming the
disruption should be incorporated into the robust and open architectures for the metaverse. Organizational resilience could
be attained by utilizing blockchain-enabled smart contracts
for all the transactions [45]. The metaverse integration with
Industry 5.0 will attract more customers through virtual factory tours and interactive sessions, enabled with XR devices’
help. The metaverse also allows virtual product presentations
and aids in mass personalization. Payments can be securely
processed between organizations and users through the use
of blockchain technologies. AI-powered digital assistants are
used in the metaverse, which will improve customer service
and the real-world customer experience.
III. THE METAVERSE FOR DIFFERENT VERTICALS OF
INDUSTRY 5.0
The metaverse is a virtual environment with computergenerated 3-D objects, avatars, and communication devices.
Users from remote locations interact through this environment
for a specific purpose in real-time. They have been used in
several domains from education to entertainment. This section
explains how the metaverse is used in multiple Industry 5.0
applications.
A. THE METAVERSE IN AGRICULTURE 5.0
Agriculture 5.0 is one of the applications of Industry 5.0,
in which smart farms implement precision agriculture and
utilize devices that include automated intelligent systems and
unmanned vehicles. Agriculture 5.0 came into existence by
integrating agricultural robots with AI techniques. Also, it
helps the farmers to increase the crop yield and reduce the
operational costs [46], [47], [48].
The metaverse in Agriculture 5.0 provides numerous benefits, such as creating a virtual environment where farmers
can collaborate with trained professionals worldwide to share
expertise and best practices. In Agriculture 5.0, the metaverse
is vital in training farmers to carry out harmful or dangerous
tasks in a safe environment. Farmers, in collaboration with
machines, can acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to
reduce the risk of injuries and accidents [49]. The metaverse
can simulate the complete development cycle of plants in
a virtual environment, which helps the users and robots to
acquire information about plant growth in a quick time [50],
[51]. Several smart farming helper applications have been
developed, automating the entire smart farming process from
cultivation to harvesting using AR, VR, and AI. The system
consists of the automated application of fertilizers and water
by detecting the movement of pests and soil moisture content,
plant disease diagnosis, field monitoring, crop yield analysis,
water stress and soil erosion monitoring. Fig. 1 depicts the
application of the metaverse in agriculture 5.0. The metaverse
will be vital in Agriculture 5.0 to increase food production
and obtain maximum profit in the forthcoming years. Developing and implementing the metaverse for Agriculture 5.0 is
complex and challenging. High-quality, portable metaverse
models are required for implementation. One of the biggest
challenges in adopting metaverse in Agriculture 5.0 would be
making the farmers aware of these advanced elements’ technological advancements, production yield, yield promotion,
FIGURE 1. The metaverse in agriculture 5.0.
and other monetary benefits. Also, highly skilled training is
needed to use the metaverse, which is developed using VR
and AR technologies and devices [52].
B. THE METAVERSE IN SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT 5.0
Supply chain management helps industries meet requirements
and deliver customized products to consumers in a short span
of time. The supply chain in the entire industrial process
must be streamlined with current enterprise modelling for
better adoption in the industrial revolution and other advancements [53]. DT technology is applied to create a digital copy
of the SCM processes, such as inventories, warehouses, logistics, and assets. It helps in the complete lifespan of SCM. The
simulation helps the DT to acquire the data from IoT devices,
which AI can use to forecast the hurdles in the various stages
of SCM. This helps the manufacturers take preventive steps
to reduce errors and losses throughout SCM. Cobots also play
a vital role in SCM processes by performing labour-intensive
and sensitive tasks, lifting heavy items, assembling material,
and checking the quality of products timely [3], [54].
The metaverse can improve the SCM’s effectiveness, from
customer requirements to product development, by enabling
human and machine collaboration. Machinery, factory layouts, raw materials, and goods can be represented in virtual
form using DTs. The developers can modify the shapes of
the products and analyze the various materials and goods
by collaborating with experts worldwide in real-time. This
technology could help in reducing the production time. The
manufacturers can share the 3D designs of various parts to
identify the best material supplier. Warehouse workers use
AR to trace the current position of products in the supply
chain. VR forms realistic supply chain simulation simulations
to train workers against usage and preventive measures. Fig. 2
depicts the metaverse in SCM. A virtual warehouse can also
be designed to have a stock layout plan before it can be transformed into a physical warehouse. The data in the physical
warehouse can be integrated with the virtual zone so that
the employees can find the number of goods, the location
of the products, and the orders placed so far. Hence, the
FIGURE 2. The metaverse in Supply Chain Management 5.0.
metaverse will enhance the SCM in the industrial sectors by
adopting various lean manufacturing philosophies eliminating
the wastes which are not intended for critical to quality parameters in the perspective of the customer. The major challenges
of the metaverse in the SCM are skilled labour, security, and
privacy. SCM covers the data flow of the entire manufacturing
process. Therefore, secured data transactions and the privacy
of sensitive information must be assured while incorporating
the metaverse technology in SCM.
C. THE METAVERSE IN HEALTHCARE 5.0
The advancements in the healthcare industry ensure humans’
physical and mental well-being, promoting a more significant
contribution to a country’s economic growth and industrialization [55]. Using AR/VR, telemedicine, AI, data analytics, and
IoT technologies, the metaverse Healthcare 5.0 system aims to
provide effective and real-time medical services. In collaboration with doctors and machines, these technologies form an
interconnected healthcare system that improves patient care
through remote monitoring, improves healthcare services, and
strengthens healthcare research and education. The robots can
diagnose and treat patients through proper doctor guidance
and instructions. The upsurge of the metaverse has brought
numerous prospects in almost all sectors. Some of the advantages of the metaverse in Healthcare 5.0 are Personalized
treatments for patients through wearables, Social, communal
space among the healthcare community, Medical IoT assisted
with VR and AR for holographic construction with intelligent
processing, Exercises rehabilitation for elderly and disabled
patients and VR-aided therapies for nervous system diseases,
anxiety, and fear disorders, and post-traumatic stress.
Yang et al. considered the metaverse as the medical IoT
aided with VR and AR glasses which are believed and
expected to contribute widely to future computing platforms [56]. However, though the medical IoT has solved many
problems, like virtually connecting rural doctors with expert
doctors worldwide, these doctors were not always available to
assist rural doctors. This paved the way for the metaverse in
healthcare through medical IoT assisted with VR, and AR,
which can overcome these limitations through holographic
FIGURE 3. The metaverse in Healthcare 5.0.
construction with intelligent processing to holographic emulation. In turn, this will improve the control in virtual-real
word interconnection, guaranteeing graded and customized
treatment, thereby balancing the doctors’ interaction on par
with internal standards. Furthermore, the healthcare metaverse
was suggested to be a good platform for exercise rehabilitation
for elderly and disabled patients [57].
Likewise, Liu et al. have highlighted the integration of various technological advancements for the benefit of healthcare
stakeholders based on bibliometric analysis for the healthcare metaverse like VR-aided therapy and their applications,
namely, nervous system diseases, anxiety and fear disorders, post-traumatic stress, physical therapy, psychotherapy
and pain management, to attain Health 4.0 [58] and can be
integrated with emerging advances to offer patient-centric
customized therapy services. The metaverse has been employed in cardiovascular medicine where the doctor will meet
the patient avatars for treatment and diagnosis [55]. Fig. 3
depicts the metaverse in healthcare. Furthermore, Chen and
Zhang conducted a bibliometric analysis on the heath metaverse [59]. The health metaverse framework suggested will
promote a better imprint on the medical field and social governance. As a result, the health metaverse was recommended
for remote health monitoring, clinical data monitoring, orthopedic surgery, and patient’s physical fitness through a 3D
— -immersive environment [60]. Although metaverse-based
healthcare provides efficient healthcare solutions, data security (unauthorized exposure of wearables), data privacy (group
privacy and individual privacy), and users’ mental health
imbalance for the metaverse adoption are the challenges in
its implementation. Another primary concern is scalability;
when more doctors, patients, and other healthcare professionals simultaneously use the system, the response time and
computational requirement will increase. Furthermore, various health implications of using gadgets for prolonged periods
should be analyzed, and appropriate measures for mitigating
this must be incorporated in implementing the metaverse.
This, in turn, can suggest a more customized usage of gadgets
for the patients and can promote a sustainable digital environment.
FIGURE 4. The metaverse in education 5.0.
D. THE METAVERSE IN EDUCATION 5.0
The metaverse has changed most of our daily interactions
to the virtual environment, transforming the human lifestyle
and community. The metaverse can help in various teaching
and learning activities such as classrooms, museums, libraries
etc. In this technology, students can navigate from the conventional classroom to a virtual environment [61]. It is very
similar to video gaming, which is very familiar to the students,
and it can propel them to come closer to the learning process
in a very interactive, entertaining, and enjoyable manner [62].
In the metaverse Education 5.0, simulations can be created
in a virtual world with the actions performed by avatars to expand the imagination and improve collaborative intelligence.
The authors in [44] highlights the significance of collaborative
intelligence by harnessing the individual strengths and thereby
enhancing the problem-solving capabilities, efficiency, productivity, adaptability and flexibility. The cost efficiency can
also be guaranteed as the need for physical training set up
and associated costs can be greatly reduced. The workers
can remain updated regarding the significant industrial advancements by training them on handling new technologies,
tools, and other systems. Such engaging experiences will
make learning more enjoyable for the trainees. Using the AR
gadgets, the students can move around and view the day-today happenings and the historical incidents through which
they gain real-time experience and knowledge. When MR
is integrated with VR technology, the students can experience the field trip where they can physically communicate
with the virtual ancient buildings, monuments and other archaeological locations. Medical students can benefit from the
metaverse in their education by visiting a virtual anatomy lab,
performing surgery on virtual patients, communicating with
virtual patients, and practising clinical skills in collaboration
with trained professionals. Fig. 4 depicts the metaverse in
smart education. AI and ML techniques can be incorporated
into digital avatars, which can answer the questions asked by
the students and give them a more alluring experience. The
teachers and students can easily transform into a virtual space
because they simulate the original comfortable environment to
them [63]. The metaverse can improve the smart education environment by integrating various subjects into a unique virtual
education platform for a comprehensive learning experience.
The metaverse in Education will have more impact than
other applications, as it will delve into more profound insights,
FIGURE 5. The metaverse in transportation 5.0.
collaborative learning, and more practical learning. Some of
the limitations of the metaverse in smart education are privacy
violations of data collected and processed. The freedom in the
metaverse may provoke the students to be involved in unethical activities. The students in the metaverse are immersed
in the virtual environment, which will cause confusion between the physical and artificial world [64]. Therefore, various
implications and constraints must be strictly enforced in a
reachable way for seamless knowledge transfer.
E. THE METAVERSE IN TRANSPORTATION 5.0
The metaverse can connect the physical and virtual worlds,
enabling people to accomplish all their needs in one place
without physical presence. Transportation in Industry 5.0
is the biggest vertical, which requires enormous adaptation
from the traditional way of transportation. The metaverse will
change all facets of transportation, such as aircrew transit,
public transit, logistics, staff transit, supply chain, and intelligent transport systems. Fig. 5 depicts the metaverse in
transportation 5.0. The metaverse can bring the following
changes in transportation Robotic-based mobility in inanimate objects and community spaces, named as Meta-Mobility,
Leisure traveling by reduced travel time, cost, and energy,
Autonomous Vehicle Fault detection, repair and anti-theft systems, Data-driven intelligent transportation, Safer transport
through advanced intelligence and governance.
The primary concern in the metaverse is how transportation works. In the metaverse world, people can travel to
different places without leaving their current location. In the
metaverse, people use virtual transportation methods, such as
virtual cars and virtual aeroplanes using AR/VR technology.
AR/VR improves the passenger experience by entertaining
passengers with games and videos. The integration of metaverse with Industry 5.0 allows passengers to choose their
virtual vehicles, virtual environments, and virtual locations.
Customization improves passenger happiness, comfort, and
convenience by adding a personal touch. VR simulations can
help nervous passengers reduce flight anxiety and relax during their trip. The metaverse is a digital layer that integrates
real-world transportation infrastructure, vehicles, and services
virtually, allowing humans and machines to collaborate. In the
metaverse, human-machine collaboration allows for human
interaction and intelligent decision-making. The metaverse
can be used as a training and simulation platform for autonomous vehicles, which improves transportation efficiency,
safety, and user experiences. The collaboration of humans
and machines has huge potential for shaping the future of
transportation in the metaverse.
Hyundai Motors has released a press note at CES 2022 stating its future vision on “Expanding Human Reach” through
robotics and the metaverse to realize humanity’s unconstrained liberty of movement [65]. They have also revealed the
Mobility of Things (MoT) concept, enabling mobility in inanimate objects and community spaces through robotics (Plug
and Drive module). Mobile Eccentric Droid (MobED) and
Boston Dynamics’ Spot are some of the company’s robotic
products, which can carry anything virtually towards attaining
its brand vision of progress for mobility. Furthermore, the
metaverse can play a vital role in intelligent transportation
systems [66]. They have used two case studies, Wayray’s
metaverse on Wheels (holographic deep reality display in
cars) and Nissan’s invisible to visible, and discussed various
challenges in different aspects of intelligent transportation.
The metaverse will impact employment and layoffs in
Transportation 5.0, particularly for blue-collar employees.
The metaverse may lead to changes in employment duties
and specifications in Transportation 5.0. For example, autonomous vehicles replace human drivers, decreasing driver
demand. It also provides a wide range of opportunities for
technical professionals during the development and maintenance of metaverse-enabled transportation. With the help of
advanced technologies and specialized skills, technical experts contribute to developing transportation systems and play
an essential role in successfully integrating the metaverse in
Transportation 5.0. The numerous job losses to transportation
workers must be replaced with equivalent job opportunities.
In addition, implementation constraints like security and scalability should be accounted during the transit of physical
goods.
F. THE METAVERSE IN CLOUD MANUFACTURING
Cloud manufacturing (CMfg) is one of the most demanding
networked manufacturing paradigms. CMfg is an integration
of ICT with advanced manufacturing techniques throughout
the manufacturing life cycle processes. CMfg is one of the
key technologies of Industry 4.0, enabling manufacturing with
a single click of the user requirements [67]. CMfg has a
manufacturing cloud, resource layer, virtual service layer, application layer, interface layer, and global service layer. The
manufacturing cloud encompasses the different manufacturing service providers, their resources, and services to meet
the needs of other clients on a demand basis. This export
FIGURE 6. The metaverse in cloud manufacturing.
process in CMfg realizes a multi-agent collaborative environment in the manufacturing resource layer where different
manufacturers can share their resources, such as 3D printers,
robotic arms, simulation tools, and modelling software. Also,
it enables the sharing of the manufacturers’ capabilities in
rendering different services. The core support ensured by the
CMfg will assure efficient resource management and effective
search of resource needs in addition to manufacturing life
cycle services encapsulation through the virtual service layer.
The application layer of CMfg provides dedicated collaborative applications. The interface layer helps consumers seek
different services like production, experimentation, design,
simulation, manufacturing, maintenance, and integration. The
global service layer maps the consumer requirements with
the multi-agent collaborative environment to offer a predictive and customized user experience. All these are possible
through integration technologies like IIoT, DTs, CPS, AI, and
wireless sensor networks [68]. Fig. 6 depicts the metaverse in
CMfg.
The metaverse in CMfg can assist in designing and testing the customized component in the immersive environment.
Multi-stakeholder social communal spaces such as end-users,
designers, manufacturers, and operations teams can discuss
and collaborate through their avatars for operational efficiency [69], Faster production, On-demand inventory forecasting, improve scalability in uncertain user demand thereby
reducing lead time, Low-latency response in the data processing through edge-enabled metaverse platform during larger
user demands, and DTs in the metaverse can reduce the
quality control risks. The major issue in incorporating the
metaverse with CMfg would be security threats in hyper communal connectivity and interoperability among heterogeneous
service providers [70]. Furthermore, scalability regarding
CMfg consumers and the general metaverse community users
will be another hectic issue.
G. THE METAVERSE IN ROBOTIC AUTOMATION
As Industry 5.0 aims to bring the human touch back to the
production floor and development by teaming up with humans
and collaborative robots, robotic automation is one of the
most critical components of Industry 5.0. Though the cobots
depend on human intelligence, they must be automated in
such a way as to cope with human commands without any
consequences in the new production environment. Here, the
cobots are intended to do labour-intensive tasks and to ensure
consistency with skilled humansâ cognitive skills [71]. The
integration of safety protocols and ergonomic considerations
in human-robot interactions is important for building a safe
and efficient workplace. It involves an amalgamation of technology, design and technical safeguards. Using a real-time
monitoring system to ensure safety in environments where
humans and robots collaborate. Real-time monitoring systems
identify potential hazards and notify human and robot management systems. These systems monitor the robots’ actions
and human activities to avoid mistakes and accidents [72].
Robots designed with fail-safe mechanisms automatically
shut down or shift to a safe state when they detect a malfunction or a potential threat to human safety. The machines
providing fail-safe mechanisms are designed to respond safely
in case of a malfunction or failure. This feature aids in the
prevention of serious accidents caused by robot malfunctions
or unanticipated human errors [73]. Ergonomic designs in
human-robot interaction are important for enhancing safety
and reducing the risk of injury. Ergonomic designs help in
performing repetitive tasks which significantly reduce physical strain on human workers. Ergonomic design in robots
improves worker productivity by speeding up the development process and reducing human time spent on potentially
hazardous tasks [74].
Human-robot collaboration improves manufacturingâs environmental sustainability. This combination improves precision and efficiency while lowering material waste and
energy consumption. Humans contribute to creativity and
complex problem-solving, resulting in innovative, environmentally friendly manufacturing processes. Robots play an
important role in recycling and upcycling by increasing efficiency and material reuse. They also play an important role in
predictive maintenance, extending machinery lifecycles and
reducing the need for new equipment. Furthermore, robots
play an important role in real-time energy and resource management, streamlining operations based on their energy needs.
Human-robot collaboration helps develop sustainable technologies and materials, with robots assisting in rapid testing
and data collection while human intervention is provided.
The metaverse utilizes robotic automation more effectively
because of its intelligent functionalities. In the metaverse
environment, the human avatars (the human virtual image)
and cobots will collaborate to carry out the production tasks.
Cobots must be automated and trained to interact with human
avatars and real humans. The metaverse in robotic automation
has various functionalities. The Cobot and Avatar collaborate
to make the metaverse life reality on the production floor and
support the creation of 3D models of the patient’s anatomy,
while cobots assist doctors in carrying out an operation and
improve patient safety, operation time, and patient satisfaction. Also, in collaboration with the metaverse, a cobot creates
a virtual training environment where staff members can practice new skills without risk of injury. The metaverse helps in
FIGURE 7. The metaverse in robotic automation.
remote maintenance and repairs by allowing professionals to
remotely access machines, examine them, and then perform
virtual repairs. Fig. 7 depicts the metaverse in robotic automation.
The real-time motion mapping of avatars or robots with
that of humans is challenging. Spanlang et al. have suggested
a technique for controlling the real-time motion streaming
of avatars and robots [75]. Hyundai Motors has disclosed
its decision on “meta-mobility” through robotics automation
in the metaverse. China has introduced its first metaverse
robot by integrating IoT, AR, VR, AI, and other cutting-edge
technologies. Meta’s robotic skin was designed using thin,
rubbery plastic with magnetic particles to feel the sense of
touch. The special robotic skin, with less than 3mm with AI,
was developed in collaboration with Meta (Facebook) and
Carnegie Mellon University [76]. Also, NVIDIA Omniverse
and Microsoft have used robotics for connecting two worlds
(real and virtual) within the metaverse using 3D assets and the
creation of enterprise metaverse, respectively [4]. The metaverse in robotic automation has profound benefits, enabling
a collaborative environment where all robotic practitioners
can share and delve into developing robots of social importance. The major challenges in robotic automation are vague
use cases, continual upgradation and maintenance, improper
governance, lack of standard automation processes, attaining convincing expectations, and skilled employees. Apart
from these challenges, robotic automation for illegal causes
should be appropriately tracked and banned at its initial stages
through the adoption of proper standards and governance.
H. IMPLEMENTATION ASPECT OF THE METAVERSE IN
INDUSTRY 5.0
The metaverse-I5.0 integration requires sophisticated technical infrastructure that can accommodate immersive, interactive, and intelligent systems as depicted in the reference
architectures in [77]. The basic components for facilitating
this integration are provided by the aforementioned technologies. Consequently, the practical deployment of technologies
like 6G encompasses several essential considerations such
as Ultra-Fast Data Speeds and Latency Reduction, Scalability, AI-driven networks for Automation, Decentralized
Data Processing, Real-Time Analytics at the Edge, Localized Data Privacy and Compliance, Resilience, Redundancy,
TABLE 1. Technical Requirements for Different Verticals of Industry 5.0
AI-Powered Adaptive Environments, and Predictive Maintenance and Digital Twins. Furthermore, this interactive environment should encompass platforms like Nvidia Omniverse
for creating a virtual workspace, 3D modelling tools like
Solidworks for 3D model detailing, real-time collaboration
tools, digital twins for the real-world replica, associated software for gamification and continued performance tracking in
the entire virtual supply chain. This will promote remote collaboration and enhanced training [78]. Above all, the foremost
assistance for customer service should be in place. For the betterment of these deployment infrastructures enhanced robust
workforce optimization with continued employee upskilling
and reskilling facilities should be enforced.
1) ABLATION STUDIES
Gutierrez et al., have developed an industrial metaverse
technological framework and have conducted some studies
to evaluate the industrial metaverse by randomly selecting
people from the physical world and VR/AR world. Both
the groups were experimented with without providing prior
knowledge about corresponding virtual entities and physical
world scenarios respectively. This knowledge disparity survey was established to explore the biases associated with
human-machine interaction and other operational aspects in
both worlds [78]. On the other hand, Guo et al., have proposed
a five-layer architecture and explored the industrial metaverse
at different industrial application scenarios at industries like
BMW and Rockwell automation for learning the use of AR
and the workability of the employees. They have also observed the use of meta operators for guided manufacturing
could reduce the workforce and associated resources in further training [77]. Some of the challenges observed by them
include optimization of industrial operations, data heterogeneity, lack of compatible integration platforms and security
concerns in the digital economy.
The various technical requirements for different verticals of
Industry 5.0 and its coverage in the applications discussed in
this section are summarized in Table 1. The various technical
requirements in Table 1 are:
1) TechR 1 ← Computation Power
2) TechR 2 ← Memory Management
3) TechR 3 ← Scalability
4) TechR 4 ← Accessibility
5) TechR 5 ← Interoperability
6) TechR 6 ← Security and Privacy Issues
7) TechR 7 ← Legal Issues
8) TechR 8 ← Skilled Professionals
9) TechR 9 ← Brain-computer Interfaces
10) TechR 10 ← Interdependencies among different societal applications
IV. THE METAVERSE IN INDUSTRY 5.0:
RESEARCH PROJECTS
This section highlights some of the key research projects related to the metaverse and Industry 5.0.
A. WAYRAY

environment for its users to shop for Nike merchandise,
play games, and interact with other users. Nikeland provides
the accountability and traceability of virtual objects by using features of blockchain technology. This allows users to
virtually try on different varieties of shoes using AR technology, which enhances the user’s buying experience. Nike will
also be significantly benefit by acquiring data insights about
their product design and manufacturing process, which will
help them improve their marketing strategies. Nikeland transformed traditional retail and SCM by providing an engaging
and data-driven environment [85].
C. MINECRAFT EDUCATION EDITION
Minecraft Education Edition was developed by Xbox Game
Studios and Mojang Studios, mainly for use in educational environments. Minecraft Education Edition is an application that
integrates the metaverse and Education 5.0. It offers students
an immersive learning environment in which they can explore
topics using virtual environments and interactive activities.
The platform encourages collaborative learning, personalization, and global access for professionals. Minecraft Education
Edition transforms education by encouraging creativity, engaging students, and preparing them for the digital era by
using cutting-edge technology and gamification [86].
D. LANDIAN
Landian is the metaverse-based agriculture 5.0 project that allows the purchasing of land and digital assets in the metaverse.
It provides a platform for farmers to interact, share knowledge,
and teach new framing techniques to each other. Landia uses
the NEAR protocol based on the Binance blockchain specifically designed for the metaverse platform. Landin provides
farmers with various benefits, including the ability to collaborate and share farming methods virtually. Farmers can also
gather relevant educational resources related to farming and
can exhibit their agricultural products in virtual marketplaces.
These marketplaces also allow farmers to buy and sell agricultural products. Landian shows a huge potential to transform
the agricultural sector by integrating the metaverse [87].
E. HEALTHBLOCKS
HealthBlocks is a startup with an aim to inequality in global
healthcare. It is a project that integrates the metaverse with
Healthcare 5.0. It uses blockchain technology to provide decentralized and secured access to healthcare services. The
users can communicate with doctors from anywhere, access
medical information, and obtain doctor’s prescriptions in a
virtual environment provided by the metaverse. HealthBlocks
will help in increasing the effectiveness and quality of patient
treatment by making healthcare available and budget-friendly
to everyone. Users will be highly benefited by its simple access to healthcare services from anywhere around the world.
HealthBlocks looks like a promising solution that has the huge
potential to revolutionize the healthcare sector with the help
of the metaverse [88]. In recent times, industry giants such as
Facebook, Google, and Microsoft have invested huge amounts
of money in hiring people with expertise in the metaverse.
Some of the other important case studies include GE’s digital
twins for gas turbines, Siemens manufacturing plants simulation, crypto projects and collaborative design platforms.
Furthermore, the industrial metaverse has been closely aligned
in promoting 17 sustainable development goals [89].
V. CHALLENGES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
In this section, we highlighted the integration challenges of
the metaverse for Industry 5.0, along with possible future
directions.
A. RESEARCH CHALLENGES
Automation in everything will almost raise issues like higher
computational requirements, data security, user privacy, health
issues, and joblessness from the users’ perspective. But, on
the other hand, from the developers’ and technology seekers’ perspectives, providing a more dynamic and responsive
human-machine interaction, lack of proper standards, security
vulnerabilities, and the adoption of technological advancements will be the more imperative challenges. As per [97],
there is still more work to be carried out to truly replicate
the real-world experience. One of the essential tradeoffs to
be considered upon integration is job security, as automation
is increased, there may be a chance for potential layoffs for
labourers due to skill gaps. On the other hand, truly satisfied customers with enhanced flexibility could not assured in
the fully automated environment. Above all implementation
and maintenance costs could increase enormously. However,
fostering the partnership and global collaboration would help
in overcoming these challenges. This section highlights the
research challenges, feasible solutions, benefits, and further
directions for future research in implementing the metaverse.
Challenges in the metaverse ecosystem and possible benefits
in mitigating those challenges are shown in Table 2.
1) USER INTERACTION
The metaverse employs several interactive devices to immerse
the users into a virtual world. These devices are being developed to fulfill the user requirements. The features of user
interactive devices that will help to interact with the virtual
world should be portable, lightweight, comfortable, and wearable. The medium of interaction should be transparent in such
a way that the technology should be invisible to the users, and
they should not drown themselves in the virtual environment.
Some of the interactive technologies and devices are VR, AR,
and MR. With VR, users can immerse themselves in the same
way as they do in the real world. AR is a technology through
which users interact with the virtual world, and it depends
on wearable devices that help to merge digital objects with
live video. MR is an advanced technology in which the physical environment performs interactions using the collected
digital data. Most of these interactive devices are portable,
lightweight, and comfortable. The high expensive cost of interactive devices is one of the major challenges in adopting
virtual technology. Prolonged use of VR headsets will create
psychological issues, neck and head tiredness. Apart from
these hardware challenges, there are some issues in the quality
of developed metaverse models. Therefore high-quality VR,
AR and MR gadgets and reliable models can help the users
for better interaction [63].
TABLE 2. Challenges in the Metaverse Ecosystem and Possible Benefits in Mitigating Those Challenges
These issues can be avoided through realistic effects in a visual rendering, enabling users to touch and feel the effect like
ball bounces or water rippling, but tactical emotions are still
difficult [98]. Holograms and eye lenses can be used alongside
head-mounted devices to provide a sustainable interface [99].
This can help in avoiding the misinterpretation of human
emotions by avatars. Integrating the metaverse with Industry
5.0 is challenging since humans and machines must make
decisions. Due to the fact that humans cannot directly touch or
feel the physical prototype provided by machines, they may be
misled while making judgments. Furthermore, the interaction
between humans and machines must be uninterrupted, and
network or bandwidth delay will lead to catastrophic situations. The devices or equipment now used for interaction
may not be suitable in all verticals of Industry 5.0 and need
customization based on the requirements of the application.
Therefore, creating a perfect virtual replicate of real industrial
machinery is still a challenge to be addressed. Furthermore,
interoperability between different hardware, communication
protocols and software platforms remains a significant challenge in this metaverse-I5.0 integration.
2) COMPUTING RESOURCES
One of the most prominent challenges in implementing the
metaverse is the convergence of various technologies like IoT,
VR, AR, AI, gaming, and so on by accommodating varying
computational requirements. Also, colossal data accumulation
may require higher and faster computing power with ultralow latency. The metaverse is like a massively multiplayer
gaming environment that allows multiple users to participate
simultaneously, requiring higher GPU and HMDs to render
an immersive virtual world balanced with the physical world.
So, edge computing with cognitive edge services will be an
essential candidate for the metaverse to serve ubiquitously. By
leveraging AI, local decisions like positioning an avatar can be
made at end devices.
Furthermore, the expensive foreground rendering (which
requires lower latency and fewer graphics) can be done at
edge servers instead of the cloud servers to reduce end-to-end
data latency. The aggregated data can later be communicated
to cloud servers. At the same time, the higher computational
intensive background rendering can be done at the cloud
servers. Consequently, AI models can be utilized for resource
allocation in these denser user distributions to improve the
Quality of Experience. Therefore, AI-enabled edge computing
would help to solve the computation overhead issue [100].
The metaverse relies on high-speed, low-latency networks. In
the context of I5.0, where the human-AI collaboration along
with real-time control systems are extremely important, any
possible latency in virtual interactions may result in significant operational impacts, particularly in industries such as
healthcare and manufacturing. Thus, integrating the metaverse
with Industry 5.0 requires massive processing power to operate all of the enabling technologies and devices, which is a
significant challenge to address. To address the computational
needs of the metaverse across multiple Industry 5.0 sectors,
high-performance computing systems and massive cloud infrastructures are also required. A network with strong data
transmission capabilities is also required for efficient usage
of computational systems.
3) SCALABILITY
Scalability, the ability of the industrial metaverse environment
to scale and serve the demands of the increased number of
users, and associated transactions through proper utilization
of resources is a mandated concern to be scrutinized specifically, in applications like Agriculture and healthcare. The
industrial metaverse could effectively manage the scalability
through IoT and can effectively promote precision agriculture
by providing appropriate notifications to users on agricultural
alerts and thereby promoting sustainable partnership and collaboration through connected research [101]. Similarly, more
scalable and connected healthcare facilities could promote
enhanced treatment of any diseases globally. To promote a
more scalable industrial metaverse environment, the industrial metaverse deployment must have a strong computational
ability, low-latency responses for an immersive experience,
scalable data stores and optimized rendering of resources.
4) SECURITY AND PRIVACY
In the social virtual world in today’s plurality of the Internet
with heterogeneous sources, the users find the communities
matching their preferences, thus preferring to have a singleton
match for their choices. This requirement for the search for
a singleton online community of preferred choices is one of
the main reasons for the emergence of the metaverse. On the
other hand, the uniqueness of the metaverse is a single by
aggregation of various technologies, services, and goods as
a shared and centralized service point. Furthermore, security
in the metaverse comes with two different verticals: data security and software security. So, this centralized metaverse
may force new users to participate in its environment, and
many behave weirdly to compete with other users (some may
exploit too). AI singularity can make AIs in the metaverse
life unaware of itself and continuously improve to perform
better [91].
As in any technological advancements, Security and Privacy remain a significant challenge upon the integration of the
metaverse with Industry 5.0. The metaverse enables large user
engagement across different Industry 5.0 sectors, and users
have to share sensitive information with these applications to
access the services. Any attack on such sensitive data could
compromise user data privacy, which is a problem that must be
addressed. One of the fundamental elements of the metaverse
is user anonymity, which raises concerns regarding accountability and transparency, potentially affecting the concept of
Industry 5.0. This integration also opens up the possibility
for creating new virtual assets depending on the Industry 5.0
sectors, and, in turn, securing them will be a further challenge
that must be addressed.
5) CYBERSYNDROME: SOCIAL MEDIA ADDICTION AND
CYBERBULLYING
The metaverse faces many emotional challenges due to the
fundamental technologies such as VR and AR on which they
are being developed. These technologies control the behaviors, emotions and intelligence of the users. The diversion of
users’ attention in locality-based metaverse applications can
end up with destructive disasters. The most common health
issues related to virtual technologies are drowsiness, blurred
vision, nausea, and motion syndrome. In a recent survey,
nearly 50% of adults utilize social media in their day-to-day
life during the pandemic period. A keypad application named
Catch a word program was developed to safeguard young
Indonesians from cyberbullying type of issues in social media. However, predicting an avatar’s behaviour is difficult as
avatarsâ behaviour is diverse and delicate. The detection of
malicious activity (bullying) by an avatar can be achieved by
considering multiple factors, such as gestures, facial recognition, emotion, and social interaction [102]. The incorporation
of the metaverse into I5.0 presents challenges in terms of work
addiction. The metaverse provides a platform for experts or
humans to interact with machines that is always accessible and
available. Because of this seamless integration, individuals
will find it difficult to stabilize their personal and professional
lives, which in consequence may lead to mental imbalance and
may be prone to health disorders. Therefore, better means for
stabilizing these concerns upon industrial metaverse implementation must be addressed. The integration of the metaverse
with I5.0 will result in a highly competitive work culture,
which will place enormous strain on employees and may lead
to stress and health problems.
6) IMPACT OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERFACES(HCI) ON
HUMAN MENTAL WORKLOAD
The advancement of technologies and HCIs with higher
computing power has led our lives to a technology-based
ecosystem. The metaverse uses VR, AR, XR, or MR technologies to connect the physical and virtual worlds. The major
challenge is dropping the human workload requirements while
participating in the metaverse ecosystem and in analyzing the
metaverse environment’s usability based on user involvement.
The human workload can be determined by weighted perceptions of different factors such as physical demand, mental
demand, performance, effort, temporal demand, and frustration [92]. The effect of XR on six dimensions of human
workload has been investigated in [103]. TOn the other hand,
VR doesn’t affect human workload as the VR interfaces are
very natural as the current reality. Also, VR interfaces do
not utilize more cognitive power of the human mind, and
they provide an immersive user experience, thus making them
feel reality. At the same time, AR imposes various perceptual challenges as it receives visual cues from heterogeneous
multimodal sources. However, the combination of VR and AR
does not increase the user workload requirement On the other
hand, adult users, patients and kids may apply more workload
while using extended realities and require more tolerance of
discomforts [104]. The special effects of emotional intelligence have been analyzed to mitigate these consequences, and
an improved Web-based XR framework has been suggested to
improve the emotional intelligence in the metaverse life [105].
Physiological signal technology can be adapted to learn in
depth about human emotions through human body signals in
the metaverse ecosystem [95]. Thus, the amalgamation of the
metaverse into Industry 5.0 presents significant challenges in
human mental workload. The metaverse delivers massive volumes of data feed to specialists, such as statistics, forecasts,
and suggestions. This massive amount of information on specialists could cause congestive overload and, in turn, decrease
overall performance. Therefore, more data accumulation will
be a hindrance that must be addressed. The metaverse enables
people to multitask with machines, but a technological issue
or attack could pressure humans tremendously.
7) IMPACT ON SUSTAINABLE FUTURE GOALS
Sustainable development goals focus on three pillars: economy, environment and society [106] to ensure an ecologically
friendly future by adopting cutting-edge technologies like
metaverse and Industry 5.0. The metaverse technology has
both positive and negative impacts on environmental and societal aspects. Digitization or technological innovation empowered with AI solutions has made accessing various services
available for people of all varieties easy. This has improved
economic stability to a greater level, created greater digital
connectivity among people, and opened up many business
opportunities. On the other hand, manufacturing of these has
led to resource depletion through hazardous wastes, job insecurity, digital addiction, and increased cyber vulnerabilities
and data privacy concerns [107]. In [106], the author evaluated
the metaverse technology acceptance and adoption based on
these three pillars to ensure sustainability by exploring the
metaverse impacts with 311 users.
1) The metaverse impacts: environmental sustainability:-
The immersive nature of the metaverse has various
positive impacts on environmental sustainability such
as reduced carbon dioxide emissions through collaborative interactions attained by telepresence, reduced
energy consumption and resource utilization through
not-requirement of physical infrastructure for businesses to meet, reduced manufacturing wastes through
âtry-before-you-buyâ AR feature. But, resources utilized by gadgets and technologies in an empowered
industry 5.0 environment will emit huge quantities of
greenhouse gases, and training an AI model with numerous data and cloud gaming will generate more carbon
dioxide than the normal scenario of travel. Furthermore, the e-waste from continuously adopting digital
technologies will pollute the land firms, soil and water
resources [108].
2) The metaverse impacts: economic sustainability:- This
has been referred to long-term continued stability and
balance in the stakeholders’ financial goals in the metaverse environment chain. The metaverse, with other
digital technologies, can perform more labour-intensive
tasks faster with greater accuracy than humans, leading
to higher productivity with reduced cost and time. The
virtual economy by the metaverse will be a good source
of income by covering various verticals of Industry
5.0 and promoting job offers to individuals throughout
the globe, irrespective of geographical location. Also,
continued economic progress can be attained by enhancing the stakeholders’ economy, like creators, platforms,
business people, and so on [109]. In financial services,
the metaverse can stabilize the economy by democratizing various investment opportunities by underpinning
the transactions with distributed ledger technology and
blockchain. Although economic stability can be attained, it cannot assured for all the people with different
literacy levels. People engaged in non-technical jobs
will suffer a lot before adopting the new technology, and
businesses promoting these gadgets may also require
extensive usage; otherwise, big economic losses may be
enforced.
3) The metaverse impacts: social sustainability:- The immerse and virtual economy of the metaverse can avoid
social divides, promote mental well-being, bring all
the people together without any limitations, promote
social health services promoting societal well-being,
e-governance makes people participative easily, and virtual learning promotes education for all from anywhere.
This immersive environment will help businesses have
a 360-degree view of their customers and can learn the
customers’ online behaviours effectively. On the other
hand, the negative aspects of society include digital
addiction, magnification of social media non-promotive
content, social violence, and prolonged exposure, which
may lead to new health sicknesses affecting different
parts of the body due to radiation.
Therefore, both positive and negative aspects of sustainable
technology adoption must be considered.
8) ETHICAL ISSUES AND SOCIETAL IMPACT
The AR and VR devices used to access the metaverse environment in Industry 5.0 applications can capture the human
brain’s behavior and grab the user’s attention. Few applications can involve the users in gathering personal data and
storing it on a permanent storage medium like blockchain.
It is common for most users to accept the privacy policy
without reading the full content. Laws and regulations can be
imposed to overcome this in the metaverse environment, and
ethical restrictions should be defined globally to prevent such
problems. Being a next-generation technology, the virtual environment should frame good moral and ethical standards to
preserve a safe metaverse environment. Some of the ethical
issues in the metaverse are misuse of the virtual environment,
unauthorized access, incorrect information, and copyright and
intellectual property violations. The regulations of the metaverse should be enhanced by formulating suitable laws that are
being upgraded frequently as per the industry requirements
and safety concerns [5]. This is critical because organizations
could integrate AI-powered behavioral analysis within the
AR/VR environments. Compliance with existing regulations
such as GDPR will also help in adjusting the policies and practices [110]. Also, it is essential to ensure the sustainability of
technological systems, facilitate cultural and social changes,
achieve interoperability and universal standards, and maintain
ethical use of technologies. Ethical guidelines of conduct in
the virtual world (including developers, participants/avatars,
and designers) and the real world based on the principles of
generic consistency for universal rights have been discussed
in [111]. They have also suggested an ethical framework for
the virtual world covering all virtual agents and their collaboration with real-world agents. The ethical issues concerning
the evolution and usage of the metaverse and Web3 gaming
applications were discussed in [112].
9) STANDARDIZATION
The metaverse is a virtual environment associated with the
physical world in various dimensions of Industry 5.0 applications. It is next-generation Internet technology implemented
using various concepts such as decentralization, submersion,
automation, and proliferation. Several Industry 5.0 applications started developing these technologies with open source
and standalone systems integrated with audio and visual experiences. In order to avoid facing legal issues with virtual
technology, new standards and principles should be framed.
The metaverse is a fantasy world where independence and
liberty can lead to crimes and misconduct [113]. Proper standards must be in force to avoid negative consequences in the
virtual world, or it will result in increasing the chances of abusive and criminal activities in the metaverse environment [63].
An open platform that includes a common collection of
devices and methodologies should be developed where the
virtual technology can be built with the available standard
tools [96]. Currently, there is a lack of a comprehensive
regulatory framework to manage issues dealing with digital
property rights, intellectual property within virtual environments, and the management of personal data in immersive
environments. Managing digital identity is yet another matter
of concern as there are no clear rules that state who controls
and verifies the identities and the after effects of improper use
of digital identities.
10) INTEROPERABILITY
When technologies meet together for more robust advancement, interoperability among various devices, the metaverse
server technologies, protocols and other similar worlds is crucial. Therefore interoperability among these diverse devices
and communication protocols is one of the biggest implementation challenges. Furthermore, to attain global collaboration
and partnership for seamless and connected services interaction with other metaverse worlds is required. MetaOpera is
an interoperable protocol to enable one such communication
with different metaverse worlds [114]. This interoperability among devices and gadgets by different vendors and
other applications is required for a more functional industrial
metaverse. Interoperability depends on the standardization of
data formats and communication protocols to provide smooth
integration and efficient data flow across diverse devices
and systems. Consequently, both forward and backwardscompatible communication standards should be in force to
enable smooth data migration and communication with conventional and upcoming systems.
Some of the regulatory solutions for the metaverse, like
standard restriction in user monitoring, emotional analysis,
virtual product promotions, and simulated personas, were
discussed in [115]. Furthermore, a forum for the metaverse
standards was formed for research studies on open standards
for different regulatory requirements of the metaverse ecosystem, and interoperability is being conducted [116]. Also as
AI is revolutionizing today’s computing environment, appropriate standards for AI governance, AI interoperability
standards for vendors, Digital identity verification and global
governance must be enforced for a more robust and secured
industrial metaverse environment.
B. FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Based on the challenges presented in the previous section,
this section provides feasible solutions that can address those
challenges.
1) META BLOCKCHAIN WITH SIXTH-GENERATION
(6G) NETWORKS
One of the major concerns in the metaverse ecosystem is
security and data privacy, as the ecosystem itself is a virtual social world. All the threats for social media users
will penetrate more in this socialized environment. Some
of them are cyberbullying and cyber flashing, which are
sometimes very dangerous. As the users exchange their sensitive data over autonomous networks (maybe over untrusted
channels), ensuring trust among various users of the metaverse is a mandate needed for its existence. Blockchain,
the distributed, immutable, tokenized, and transparent ledger
technology capable of intelligent resource management and
efficient maintenance of stored transactions, will be an essential candidate [117].
In Industry 5.0, the meta-blockchain can greatly benefit
from the rapid and extensive data processing capabilities offered by 6G networks. This collaboration has the potential to
result in unmatched scalability and efficiency. 6G networks,
with their enhanced bandwidth and reduced latency, can facilitate accelerated and reliable blockchain transactions, hence
improving the efficiency of real-time data processing and
decision-making.
To address the energy demands of blockchain and 6G
in Industry 5.0, several energy efficiency strategies can be
implemented. Firstly, blockchain can be made more energyefficient through adopting methods like energy-saving consensus mechanisms, optimizing network structures, and incorporating off-chain transactions. For 6G, the focus should
be on AI-driven network optimization, harnessing renewable
energy sources, and employing distributed architectures to
minimize transmission losses. In addition, integrating smart
grids, employing demand-response energy systems, and enhancing energy monitoring are vital. Complementing these
technical approaches are regulatory measures, including the
establishment of industry standards, government policies,
and incentives. To support these initiatives, investing in research and development, and fostering collaboration among
stakeholders are crucial. Moreover, raising awareness about
energy-efficient among stakeholders practices plays a significant role in this holistic approach.
2) FEDERATED LEARNING FOR THE METAVERSE
Federated learning (FL) is the collaborative learning model
that trains the statistical models using multiple local data
without exchanging or uploading the raw data to a centralized
server [118]. Later, the encrypted parameters of the trained
local model (and not data samples) are shared among themselves, and an aggregated global model is developed at the
centralized server. Thus, edge devices like smartphones can
learn an aggregated global prediction model collaboratively
and maintain the sensitive data at local device storage, which
reduces data breaches on users’ sensitive personal data. Furthermore, this shared aggregated global model is integrated
with local models. Therefore, FL will ensure continual learning without data breaches due to private data aggregation and
reduce the communication overhead [119], specifically for the
larger models of complex scenarios with massive data [120].
Hence, FL, with the metaverse, can help the ecosystem to
be safe and serve better. FL has been employed in various
applications with massive data collection, like medical institutions, AR, and digital twinning cities. The authors in [121]
have proposed an FL-based solution for collaborating smart
cities’ DTs, ensuring faster status updates through the shared
local strategy of DTs. Here, the DTs share only the parameters
of the locally trained model with each other, and the global
model is constructed with accumulated insights from shared
local strategy.
Furthermore, blockchain can be utilized for securing the
aggregated model in FL [122]. Therefore, FL can be employed
in the meta-blockchain ecosystem for privacy-preserving data
sharing. In the FL-integrated meta-blockchain ecosystem, the
metaverse users can train their model using local device data
and share their training parameters with the model creator.
This will reduce the communication overhead as the parameters are considerably smaller than the raw data. Also, the
model aggregations can be carried out at the edge server to
minimize the communication cost with the cloud [123].
3) EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN
THE METAVERSE
AI models lack transparency; even the decision-makers or developers do not completely understand the model’s decisionmaking capability, making it difficult to monitor, interpret and
be accountable [124]. Therefore, it forces its users to trust it
blindly. The black-box nature of AI hinders its widespread
and trustworthy adoption. As AI models play a vital role
in the metaverse environment, trustworthiness and interoperability are important properties [122]. Explainable Artificial
intelligence paves the way for it through its features like comprehensibility, interpretability, transparency and non-biased
decision-making. This allows the users to characterize the
model’s performance based on different perspectives. This
helps the developers understand how a specific outcome has
been attained and can modify the model as needed. Furthermore, bias from different verticals, like race, data, and models,
was suspected to be a reason for the models’ inability, leading
to more security and legal issues [125]. User engagement
in the metaverse environment could be improvised through
continuous feedback on the model’s performance [126]. The
intrusion detection system is one of the important components
of the attack-prone metaverse environment where many IoT
devices and other devices communicate. Though the existing non-transparent AI models provide better detection and
reduce the false alarm rate, it could be further improvised,
improper clarity on the decisions arrived may generate biases
and may introduce various unanswered barriers in real-time
decision making. Therefore, XAI models can ensure more
transparent and clarified decisions by effectively utilising
humanistic intelligence. Nkoro et al. have employed an explainable Deep Neural Network for detecting threats in the
metaverse, thus assuring a more secured, trustworthy metaverse network intrusion detection [127]. Therefore, XAI, with
other security enhancements, could secure the metaverse system in a better way.
4) QUANTUM COMPUTING IN THE METAVERSE
Quantum computing (QC) is a phenomenon that applies principles of quantum physics to generate more powerful ways
of computing. QC stores and processes the data using individual ions, atoms, photons, or electrons, creating a faster
and more powerful computer. QC’s two principles are quantum entanglement (lack of independence) and superposition
(simultaneously allowing the possible combinations of zeros
and ones). For example, QC is made of qubits, allowing the
data to exist either in 1 or 0 or simultaneously in a 1 and
a 0 [128]. However, the complexity lies in designing the
computers for operating the world of quantum physics, and
QC may be a more significant threat to those applications
relying on encryption [129]. In addition, quantum technology, called quantum cryptography, creates a unique quantum
channel for data transmission, thus alleviating eavesdropping
and other network attacks [130]. As blockchain is one of the
enabling technologies of the metaverse, quantum blockchain
can make computing faster and more efficient. Also, quantum
ML has been used in several critical applications, and the
quantum-resistant security solutions will bring the metaverse
to life [131]. The metaverse ecosystem with more dynamic interactions can be implemented effectively with these security
solutions.
5) HYPERSCALE COMPUTING FOR THE METAVERSE
Scalability is one of the major concerns in any hyperautomation system, where the number of users will be
increasing every minute. Hyper-scale computing allows efficient scaling from a minimum number of servers to thousands
of servers to attain massive scalability in the distributed
computing environment. Furthermore, hyper-scale computing
features horizontal scalability, redundancy, and high throughput, making it best suited for applications expecting enhanced
performance, fault-tolerant, and high availability [132]. On
the other hand, the metaverse, the most substantial transformation of human life, requires higher IT infrastructure facilities.
Therefore, more essential edge-computing services help make
this transformation possible. The primary requirements for
this transformation are hardware support processing power
for the massive computing and software. Also, this massive
computing transformation requires consistent, rapid response
and higher bandwidth data transfers multiple times more than
the current processing capacity [133]. The Hyper-scale edge
data centers, with the capability to scale efficiently to accommodate the massive computing requirements of the metaverse,
can be a possible solution. Therefore, the metaverse ecosystem will be on life with the 6G-based meta-blockchain, FL,
quantum blockchain, and hyper-scale computing environment.
