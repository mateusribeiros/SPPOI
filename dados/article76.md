ABSTRACT Smart city middleware serves as a foundational tool in the evolution of urban digitalization,
acting as an intermediary software layer that simplifies the development, deployment, and management
of applications tailored for smart urban environments. However, the development of effective middleware
for smart cities is challenging. The present research embarks on a comprehensive exploration of the smart
city middleware landscape, unraveling the intricacies of its development and the challenges faced therein.
Rooted in the assessment of 20 distinct middleware solutions, our study highlights the pivotal technologies,
features and functionalities that are imperative for a middleware to effectively support a city’s digital
transformation. The functional and non-functional requirements form the nucleus of our evaluation. We also
explore the architectural styles pivotal to middleware development and the programming paradigms shaping
smart city application development. Our study highlights challenges in using middleware for smart city
applications, such as interoperability, scalability, security amidst big data, context management, reliability,
quality of service, energy efficiency, and compliance with technological standards and regulations. Based
on the detailed analysis, we propose a conceptual framework for smart city middleware, shaped by the
challenges and requirements identified in existing literature and middleware solutions. This framework is
designed to reflect the diverse demands and complexities of urban digital transformation, and guide smart
city middleware development accordingly. As a result, this research stands as a reference study for software

I. INTRODUCTION
Smart city middleware, a key enabler in the digital transformation of urban landscapes, streamlines the creation and
management of smart city applications, though its development presents significant challenges, as explored in this
research study.
This section presents the driving forces behind the adoption
of smart city middleware, highlighting the research questions
explored in this survey. It then provides an overview of existing literature, offering context and contrasting this study with
previous research, thereby outlining the unique contribution
of this work. Finally, it presents the structure of the paper,
guiding readers through a methodical exploration of smart
city middleware solutions.
A. MOTIVATION
A smart city is essentially the consolidation of numerous
smart solutions that span across all sectors of society, working
together to improve the quality of life, increase operational
efficiency, and foster sustainable development [1], [2]. Various smart systems have been put forward for numerous urban
services, including public utilities [3], [4], transportation [5],
healthcare [6], environment [7], public safety [8], education [9] and governance [10].
The realization of such diverse systems is fundamentally
facilitated by a comprehensive suite of enabling technologies.
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) serve
as the underlying infrastructure for these smart solutions,
empowering real-time data collection, communication, and
analysis, thereby enhancing various urban services and supporting the broader vision of smart cities [11]. Internet of
Things (IoT) devices, including sensors and actuators, are
critical for monitoring urban environments and infrastructure,
and for executing automated responses [12]. Advanced data
analytics, including Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine
learning, turn the large volumes of data generated by these
devices into actionable insights [13]. For instance, these
insights can be used to optimize traffic flow, manage energy
consumption, and predict crime. Moreover, technologies like
cloud computing and edge computing provide the necessary infrastructure for data storage and processing [14],
while Blockchain technology can enhance security and transparency, particularly in digital governance [10].
While many existing solutions are specialized, focusing
on a specific domain or addressing a singular problem,
and often developed from scratch with minimal software
reuse, this approach does not sufficiently cater to the comprehensive requirements of a smart city environment [15].
The creation of independent, vertical applications for each
city domain might address individual urban challenges, but
this approach fails to tap into the potential synergies across
domains[16]. A smart city thrives on integrated solutions that
can interact and collaborate, thereby maximizing efficiency
and optimizing resource utilization across the city’s various
sectors. Therefore, while domain-specific applications have
their merits, it is the horizontal integration of these applications through common software platforms that truly drives the
realization of a smart city [17].
Smart city middleware is an integrated software platform
that acts as a supportive environment for software developers [18]. It assists in the process of designing, implementing,
deploying, and managing applications specifically tailored
for smart cities. It acts as an intermediate layer, facilitating communication, interoperability, and data integration
between diverse systems and applications within a smart
city’s digital ecosystem. This middleware provides the necessary tools and interfaces for software developers to effectively
and efficiently build and manage applications that enhance a
city’s intelligence and responsiveness.
The construction of smart city middleware poses significant challenges, among which ensuring interoperability
stands as a prominent issue [19]. This interoperability refers
to the seamless communication and cooperation between an
array of diverse components, including different systems,
applications, and devices, possibly developed by various
vendors utilizing a multitude of platforms and protocols.
Other key challenges include [15], [17], [20]: scalability,
which requires the middleware to accommodate the city’s
expansion and increasing data volumes; security and privacy,
involving stringent encryption protocols and compliance with
data protection regulations due to the vast amounts of data
involved; real-time processing to support public safety or traffic management applications; reliability and fault tolerance to
prevent severe disruptions from system downtime; integration
capabilities to seamlessly align with a range of applications;
effective data management strategies to handle abundant data
volumes from multiple sensors and sources; and lastly, strict
adherence to diverse technological standards and regulatory
guidelines across different regions.
In this research endeavor, a rigorous evaluation is conducted of efforts focused on the development of middleware
solutions for smart cities, which includes a review of relevant requirements as emphasized in existing literature. From
this analysis, a conceptual framework has been derived,
adeptly mapping considerations related to these requirements. In order to deepen understanding and identify the
characteristics that smart city middleware should embody
to facilitate the creation of comprehensive smart city applications, an analysis of 20 middleware solutions, targeted
towards smart city implementations, has been undertaken.
Guided by the objective to build comprehensive insights,
the study formulated and explored four specific research
questions, outlined as follows:
RQ1: Which enabling technologies are integral to the functionality of smart city middleware?
RQ2: What functional and non-functional requirements
characterize smart city middleware?
RQ3: What are the principal architectural styles and programming paradigms integrated in smart city middleware?
RQ4: What challenges and open issues preside over the
future of smart city middleware?

II. MIDDLEWARE SOLUTIONS FOR SMART CITIES
In this section, various smart city middleware platforms
from the literature are discussed. To identify appropriate
studies, the subsequent query string was employed: (‘‘Smart
City’’ OR ‘‘Smart Cities’’) AND (Middleware OR ‘‘Software Platform’’ OR Architecture). The review methodology
incorporated articles from both journals and conference proceedings, drawing from prominent computer science digital
repositories such as IEEE Digital Library, ACM Digital
Library, Science Direct, Springer Link, Scopus, and Google
Scholar. Using the specified search terms within the designated digital libraries, 278 articles were identified based on
a review of their titles, abstracts and keywords. Upon further
examination of the selected papers, this study concentrated
on 41 articles that delineate smart city middleware solutions.
The shortlisted papers for the final analysis were selected
based on criteria including relevance to the specific search
terms, answering at least two research questions, and being
peer-reviewed; while papers not in English, published before
2010, of minimal length, or containing solutions unsuitable
for smart city contexts were excluded.
A. AMF-CPS
AMF-CPS is an agent-based middleware framework (AMF)
that leverages distributed Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to
enhance communication reliability within smart city environments [27]. Agent-based technology in the distributed CPS,
operating autonomously and independently, mitigates data
source downtime challenges, ensuring consistent resource
sharing and response scheduling irrespective of query
demands and communication durations. This agent-based
framework was designed to function as middleware, bridging
the application and platform layers to enhance interoperability. The middleware incorporates various agents, including

execute specific tasks and are contingent upon the software and hardware attributes of the affiliated device. This
framework specifically integrates the aforementioned agents
to augment the service dissemination and resource-sharing
capabilities of data sources, making it particularly tailored for
service-centric CPS within the smart city context. The efficacy of the proposed framework is assessed through various
metrics, including resource and storage utilization, as well as
response time and downtime across diverse query requests
and durations, in a simulation environment.
B. CityPulse
The CityPulse framework facilitates the creation of smart city
services through a distributed system designed for semantic

enable cross-domain data integration by not only integrating
diverse, uncertain, and incomplete data for reliable information but also offering advanced data analytics modules for
intelligent data aggregation, event detection, quality evaluation, contextual filtering, and decision support. The CityPulse
framework consists of two main sets of components: largescale data stream processing modules for interacting with
diverse data sources and adaptive decision support modules that provide context-based recommendations. CityPulse
applications employ cloud-based components for service execution, allowing for continuous data stream monitoring and
processing, and enabling applications to retrieve real-time
city status information via APIs. Conversely, the adaptive
decision support modules are activated only when specific
recommendations or context monitoring is required, distinguishing them from the constantly running data processing
tools. The CityPulse middleware components are versatile,
suitable for various application domains, and are offered as
open-source. To streamline the development process, each
CityPulse component furnishes a set of APIs. The framework
is exemplified through a Smart Travel Planner application.

III. ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES
The most pivotal enabling technologies used in smart city
platforms are discussed in the following sections. Not only
do these technologies play a foundational role in the overall
functioning and optimization of these platforms, but they also
influence the operation, adaptability, and efficiency of smart
city middleware.
A. INTERNET OF THINGS
IoT devices, such as sensors and actuators, are instrumental in collecting and transmitting data from various city
domains [12]. This data can then be analyzed and acted upon,
making IoT a crucial component of smart city middleware.
In this context, the middleware’s role is multifold. It serves
as the critical bridge between these IoT devices, which rely
on M2M communication techniques, and the smart city applications that process and act upon the data [51]. Middleware
manages device connectivity, ensures secure and reliable
data transmission, handles data formatting and normalization,
and supports real-time processing and analysis. Leveraging
M2M protocols, the middleware facilitates seamless communication between devices, enhancing the dynamism and
responsiveness of the system. Furthermore, it enables the
orchestration of actuators based on the derived insights.
The middleware is therefore not only crucial for managing
the technical aspects of device connectivity and data management, but it also plays a fundamental role in transforming
the raw data into actionable insights and orchestrating the
execution of these insights in the real world.
B. DISTRIBUTED DATA PROCESSING AND MANAGEMENT
Smart city infrastructures are inherently heterogeneous and
deal with dynamic data flows, making centralized platforms
inadequate due to scalability and latency challenges[52]. The
growing shift towards distributed data processing allocates
tasks across interconnected tiers, each vital for timely, efficient, and secure data processing in urban environments [53].
Figure 1 provides a conceptual overview of the distributed
data processing and management within smart city middleware. The tiers discussed in subsequent sections each bring
unique advantages. Together, they form a robust, scalable, and
resilient framework tailored for the diverse needs of smart city
ecosystems. Within this framework, middleware serves as the
cohesive element, facilitating interoperability and the smooth
transition of data and control commands across various smart
city applications.
1) CLOUD COMPUTING
Cloud platforms provide the necessary computational
resources and storage capabilities required for handling, processing, and storing the massive volumes of data generated
across various sectors of a smart city [54]. By combining
the strengths of both IoT and cloud computing, the Cloud of
Things model has emerged as a comprehensive solution that
can be used to drive intelligent decision-making and actions
in the smart city applications [45], [55]. Extensions of cloud
computing models tailored for the smart city context have
been also proposed using the terms City Application Software
as a Service (CSaaS) and City Platform as a Service (CPaaS)
[15]. The CSaaS model allows city administrations to access
sophisticated applications without having to develop, manage, or maintain them in-house. CPaaS, on the other hand,
refers to a cloud environment that provides a platform for
developing, running, and managing city applications. This
accelerates the development process, reduces the time-tomarket for new applications, and makes it easier to iterate and
improve existing applications. Both these models allow for
seamless integration of diverse city applications, enable the
efficient use of resources, and allow for the rapid adoption
of innovative solutions. This plays a crucial role in the
realization of smart city goals and makes cloud computing an
essential component of smart city middleware as evidenced
by the vast majority of the solutions examined.
2) EDGE AND FOG COMPUTING
Edge and fog computing have emerged as pivotal solutions
for addressing latency-sensitive applications and alleviating
network infrastructure burdens in smart cities [56]. By situating computation closer to data sources, such as IoT devices,
edge computing optimizes latency and bandwidth. Fog computing, bridging the gap between edge and cloud computing,
allocates computation to local nodes like gateways, striking a
balance between proximity to data sources and computational
power. This strategic positioning enables prompt processing,
essential for many smart city tasks [57]. This computing
model has been adopted by FogFlow [33] to enable smart
city IoT services, SEDIA [42] to ensure swift data collection
and translation despite computational and storage constraints,
SmartCityWare [45] for efficient resource utilization, and
SmartSantander [46] to provide a programmable experimentation substrate.
3) MOBILE CROWD SENSING AND COMPUTING
Mobile Crowd Sensing and Computing (MCSC) taps into
the sensing capabilities of prevalent mobile devices like
smartphones, wearables, and in-vehicle systems to gather
and analyze urban data [58]. This approach, when integrated into smart city middleware, complements data from
traditional sources, offering a more detailed view of urban
dynamics [59]. For example, OpenIoT provides the ‘‘Urban
Crowdsensing Service’’ so that volunteers with wearable sensors can provide real-time air quality data [38]. Similarly,
the S2NetM solution merges crowd-sourced data with inputs
from IoT devices, forming a foundation for its decisionmaking [41]. The relevant approach in SmartSantander is
also noteworthy; it transforms mobile phones from mere
communication tools to versatile sensors that capture diverse
data, from locations to environmental conditions [46]. This
platform even allows users to receive alerts about ongoing
city events, fostering a deeper connection with their urban
FIGURE 1. Distributed data processing and management in the context of
smart city middleware.
surroundings. While there is a superficial similarity in that
both MCSC and edge computing can involve local data
processing on devices, their objectives, challenges, and primary use cases are quite distinct [60]. MCSC emphasizes
crowd-sourced data collection from diverse user devices,
addressing challenges related to incentivization, data reliability, and user privacy, while edge computing prioritizes
processing data near its source and is more concerned with
ensuring data integrity, reducing transmission delays, and
safeguarding local processing nodes. Additionally, emerging paradigms like Dew/Mist Computing are extending the
concept of MCSC by not only utilizing mobile devices for
data collection but also leveraging their computational power.
In this model, smartphones and similar devices act as nodes
for local data processing, decentralizing the computational
load and enabling more efficient, sustainable handling of
urban data [61], [62].
C. BIG DATA
In the context of smart cities, Big Data refers to the vast
amounts of structured and unstructured data generated from
various sources, including IoT devices, sensors, social media,
public services, and many others [63]. The data in this context is distinguishable by its inherent attributes, namely its
volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value [64]. Smart city
middleware is essentially the technological glue that binds
together all these data sources and enables the processing
and analysis of this information [28], [38], [45], [65]. It is
responsible for handling data integration, heterogeneity, security, privacy, and real-time processing, among other tasks.
Big Data technologies, such as Hadoop, Spark, and NoSQL
databases, among others, are often integrated into the middleware to efficiently process and analyze the collected data [18],
[47], [66]. An additional critical element concerning data
within smart cities is the notion of Open Data [67]. In a
smart city context, this could encompass data on various city
services such as public transportation schedules, air quality
indices, city budget allocations, public project statuses, and
more. Open Data initiatives in smart cities can significantly
enhance the diversity of Big Data available for analysis [68].
Such openness and transparency can spur the development
of innovative applications and services that elevate urban
living, as evidenced by several of the middleware solutions
examined [18], [28], [30], [42], [47].
D. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
In the realm of smart city middleware solutions, there is a
growing emphasis on harnessing Artificial Intelligence (AI)
as an enabling technology [69]. AI, particularly machine
learning and deep learning techniques, can process and
analyze large datasets, identify patterns, make predictions,
and even make decisions [70], [71]. For, instance, CityPulse incorporates a quality monitoring module that utilizes
machine learning to evaluate the data quality from various
input sources [28]. Also, the MiSCi middleware embeds
AI functionalities, demonstrating its capacity for learning,
autonomy, and reasoning, thereby ensuring that the city’s
digital responses are optimized based on past experiences and
data [37]. OpenIoT expands on this technology by incorporating machine learning algorithms and statistical methods,
facilitating enhanced data processing and informed decisionmaking [38]. Furthermore, the server tier in SmartSantander
offers a platform for exploring real-world data mining and
knowledge engineering techniques for optimizing resource
allocation and facilitating proactive decision-making [46].
E. CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are integrations of computation, networking, and physical processes [72]. In the context
of a smart city, CPS can include systems like smart grids,
autonomous vehicle systems, medical monitoring, process
control systems, distributed robotics, and automatic pilot
avionics [73]. An emerging perspective in this domain is
the concept of ‘Digital Twins’, which are virtual representations of physical assets, systems, or processes [74], [75].
Extending beyond smart cities, the paradigm of CPS is also
fundamental to Industry 4.0, characterized by interconnected
systems, automation, and data exchange in manufacturing
technologies [76]. Middleware for a smart city must bridge
the cyber world of computing and the Internet with the
physical world of infrastructure and systems. In this context,
CPS offers a model for such integration, as exemplified by
AMF-CPS [27]. InterSCity middleware, on the other hand,
facilitates the development of applications such as smart
parking infrastructures, underpinned by CPS [35]. OpenIoT
stands as a platform that fosters the integration and seamless management of CPS, facilitating data collection and
processing across both virtual and tangible devices [38].
Finally, SmartCityWare conceptualizes the components of
smart cities in both cyber and physical worlds as service
providers, ensuring that application developers can harness
these resources without being encumbered by their inherent
heterogeneity [45].
F. CYBERSECURITY
Given the critical nature of data in smart cities, robust cybersecurity measures, such as encryption, intrusion detection
systems, and blockchain technology, are indispensable [49],
[77]. Such measures not only ensure data confidentiality,
integrity, and availability but also protect against unauthorized access, alterations, or service interruptions [34], [38],
[78]. Platforms like SGeoL [18] and Civitas [29] exemplify
this commitment by managing user authentication, security
policies, data protection, and ensuring device certification
respectively. Infrastructure safety is paramount, as potential
cyber-attacks could result in physical harm or service disruptions [45], [79]. The security of IoT devices is equally
critical, especially given the potential for breaches [80].
As data seamlessly integrates across smart city systems,
secure communication, such as the use of secure MQTT with
TLS in SEDIA [42], becomes vital. Moreover, the focus of
cybersecurity transcends prevention, emphasizing resilience
under adversities and swift recovery post incidents [46],
[81]. With governments setting cybersecurity standards, especially for pivotal sectors, middleware must adhere to these
regulations to ensure urban system safety and evade legal consequences [49], [82]. Cybersecurity, therefore, emerges as a
foundational enabling technology for smart city middleware,
ensuring that the digital backbone of urban systems remains
robust, resilient, and trustworthy.
G. SEMANTIC WEB AND ONTOLOGIES
The integration of Semantic Web and Ontologies is a prominent feature across several smart city middleware solutions,
enhancing data representation, validation, and query capabilities [18], [29], [30], [38], [40]. Semantic Web technologies,
including RDF (Resource Description Framework) and OWL
(Web Ontology Language), offer standardized ways to represent and share data, facilitating interoperability between
different smart city applications and platforms [19]. The
ontology in S2NetM showcases a unique representation of
social relationships among IoT devices and incorporates
ontology alignment and reasoning mechanisms for efficient
data querying [41]. Both SGeoL [18] and SEDIA [42]
harness Semantic Web technologies for data annotation, validation, and inferencing, promoting advanced data analysis
and semantic searches. Semantic Web technologies, especially ontologies, provide a standardized way to represent
and integrate diverse data, ensuring that different systems can
understand and work with it cohesively [83]. For instance,
Snap4city utilizes the Km4City Ontology to aid in representing diverse city data, while also facilitating semantic
discovery of sensors and actuators [47]. Furthermore, middleware equipped with ontology-based reasoning capabilities
can make inferences based on existing data [18], [41], [42].
By understanding user preferences and behaviors through
semantic annotations, middleware can provide more personalized services. For instance, if a user prefers ‘‘green spaces’’
and ‘‘quiet areas’’, the middleware, as exemplified by SEDIA
‘‘Green Route’’ use case [42], can recommend routes or
destinations that fit these criteria.
H. BLOCKCHAIN
Blockchain provides a secure, transparent, and decentralized framework, enhancing the efficiency, trustworthiness,
and automation of processes in smart cities [84], [85]. Its
cryptographic mechanisms ensure secure, peer-to-peer transactions [86], while smart contracts, such as those central
to the WeValue platform functionality [49], automate and
enforce agreements, eliminating the need for intermediaries [87]. Beyond security, Blockchain’s immutable identity
verification is crucial for personalized city services and
secure access[88], and its traceability ensures the authenticity
of data and transactions [89]. In smart cities, this can be
useful for tracking supply chains, verifying the source of
goods, or ensuring the accuracy and origin of environmental
data. Beyond strengthening cybersecurity, Blockchain has
the potential to transform data storage, transaction handling,
and service delivery in smart city middleware through its
decentralized and transparent capabilities.
I. SUMMARY
Table 2 summarizes the enabling technologies adopted by
the examined smart city middleware solutions, offering a
comprehensive overview of the prevalence and integration
of these technologies in the context of urban digital infrastructure. A review of these middleware solutions points out
the ubiquity and significance of technologies such as the IoT
and Cloud Computing, which are almost universally adopted
across the solutions. Cybersecurity and Semantic Web and
Ontologies technologies are similarly recurrent, reflecting the
need for robust data protection and meaningful data interpretation. Big Data and AI, vital for scalable data management
and intelligent decision-making, are also noticeably present
in several middleware platforms. Meanwhile, Fog/Edge computing or MCSC are harnessed by a subset of these solutions,
emphasizing their relevance in particular smart city scenarios. Finally, the presence of CPS and Blockchain in a few
solutions gives their potential in enhancing seamless interactions between the digital and physical worlds as well as
transparency and security. This distribution highlights the
diverse requirements and objectives of smart city middleware,
emphasizing the need for a multifaceted approach to address
the complex challenges of smart cities.
IV. SMART CITY MIDDLEWARE REQUIREMENTS
To address the research question regarding essential requirements for smart city middleware, this section examines the
functional and non-functional requirements observed in the
studied middleware platforms. The analysis is based on two
primary criteria: direct references in literature affirming a
platform’s implementation of a requirement, and the evident
presence of components within the platform that meet the
specified requirement. This dual-focused approach aims to
provide a holistic understanding of what a smart city middleware should include.
TABLE 2. Enabling technologies used by the smart city middleware solutions.
A. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
1) DATA MANAGEMENT
a: DATA COLLECTION AND INTEGRATION
Middleware should be capable of collecting data from
numerous and heterogeneous sources, including IoT devices,
sensors, databases, and third-party systems [30], [34], [38],
[48]. To enable seamless integration from third-party sources,
the middleware can employ REST APIs [28], [35], [41],
embrace the publish/subscribe paradigm [33], [36], [46] and
leverage open data platforms [42], [47]. In essence, data
collection and integration capabilities empower smart city
middleware to bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights. Integration, in this context, is not merely about
accumulating data; it is about harmonizing and translating
this data into a cohesive format, suitable for further analysis
and action. As an illustration, the Data Integrator component
in SGeoL integrates data from multiple external systems,
standardizing it for accessibility via the Data API [18]. Given
the heterogeneity of sources, this process also entails data
validation, ensuring that the incoming data is consistent and
reliable [45], [46].
b: DATA STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL
Middleware in smart cities must provide robust data
storage solutions with efficient retrieval and querying
capabilities [33], [45]. It should accommodate both structured data, like that in relational databases, and unstructured
data, such as videos or social media content [18], [42],
[46]. As smart city data needs grow in complexity, middleware should adapt to advanced storage methods, including
distributed databases and cloud architectures [18]. Given
the demand for real-time data in many smart city applications, the middleware must also efficiently process complex
queries from multiple sources simultaneously, ensuring minimal latency [28], [33]. More specifically, SEDIA uses the
Neo4j graph database to store semantically annotated data
and to identify patterns and relationships during retrieval [42].
SGeoL integrates multiple databases, including MongoDB,
Apache Jena, and PostgreSQL with PostGIS, to handle
diverse data types[18]. In contrast, SMArc focuses on semantic data storage within its Repository Module [44], while
Snap4City employs a knowledge base and noSQL storages
for efficient data retrieval with advanced search functionalities [47]. Finally, WeValue maintains a centralized data-store
for user and group profiles, emphasizing secure storage for
sensitive data, aiding Value Agents in negotiations [49].
c: DATA PROCESSING
Data processing emerges as a key requirement in smart
city middleware solutions, pivotal for transforming raw
data into actionable intelligence. Such middleware not only
emphasizes tasks like resource management, as seen in AMFCPS [27], or real-time pattern detection, as in FIWARE [30],
but also navigates the intricacies of data processing [38].
Efficient filtering mechanisms are vital, separating essential
information from the overwhelming volume of incoming
data. This selective approach, demonstrated by platforms
like GAMBAS [34] and LinkSmart [36], ensures optimal
use of computational resources. Beyond mere normalization, middleware often undertakes intricate transformations,
converting textual data into numerical formats or reshaping
datasets for specific analytical paradigms. SEDIA [42] and
SGeoL [18], for instance, emphasize varied processing tasks,
from intensive analysis to data aggregation. Middleware
should also support data fusion, merging multiple streams
into comprehensive views. As exemplified by WeValue [49]
and SmartCityWare [45], merging data, especially when coupled with semantic enrichment or compliance adherence,
amplifies its value by offering a richer view of information.
Whether it is the S2NetM focus on dynamic SIoT environments [41] or the OpenIoT versatility in data processing
modes [38], it is clear that the ability to efficiently process,
transform, and fuse data is central to the adaptability and
efficacy of smart city middleware solutions.
2) ANALYTICS AND REPORTING
Middleware must offer a robust suite of analytics, visualization, and reporting tools to transform the massive data
generated in smart cities into meaningful insights, patterns,
and trends for informed decision-making. Visualization aids
in converting intricate data into comprehensible formats,
while customizable reporting, coupled with predictive analytics, enables administrators to understand current urban
conditions and anticipate future challenges or opportunities
as demonstrated in the Smart City Magnifier use case in
FogFlow [33]. Similarly, LinkSmart emphasizes analytics
through occupancy data analysis and underscores the significance of detailed reporting and visualization, particularly
concerning environmental conditions and energy usage [36].
On the other hand, CityPulse integrates diverse data and
uses advanced analytics in its decision support modules to
offer real-time, context-aware city recommendations [28].
SGeoL harnesses a Complex Event Processing Engine for its
data analysis tasks [18]. SmartCityWare fosters collaborative
analytics across smart buildings, aiming for precise models
for applications ranging from fault detection to demand optimization [45]. Snap4City provides a range of tools for data
analytics in environments like R, Java, and Python [47].
3) IoT MANAGEMENT
IoT management in smart city middleware is imperative
for the integration and operation of a plethora of internetconnected devices, which includes seamless onboarding,
remote configuration, continuous monitoring, lifecycle management, and stringent security protocols. The following
provides examples of such implementations. FIWARE incorporates multiple IoT agents tailored for diverse protocols,
streamlining the management of IoT devices [30]. LinkSmart
offers capabilities such as remote reconfiguration of sensor node parameters, enhancing adaptability [36]. Rimware,
designed to bolster IoT-Cloud integration, demonstrates its
focus on IoT management through case studies on BLE
device interactions and multi-adapter gateway functionalities [40]. SEDIA ensures continuous integration and communication across various IoT devices, middleware, and service
layers [42]. The IoT Manager component in SGeoL simplifies device discovery and facilitates their integration using
various protocols [18]. Finally, SmartSantander augments its
management capabilities by supporting wireless reprogramming of experimentation nodes, ensuring reliability through
multipath communication, and rapid malfunctioning node
detection [46].
4) SERVICE MANAGEMENT
Middleware for smart cities should be endowed with comprehensive service management capabilities. This encompasses
the discovery, orchestration, deployment, and monitoring of
diverse services within the smart city ecosystem. CityPulse,
for instance, highlights service discovery and composition for
effective application deployment [28]. Civitas orchestrates
diverse entities, from citizens to public institutions, highlighting the imperative of managing communication among
heterogeneous devices and services [29]. Both FIWARE [30]
and OpenIoT [38] design prioritize adaptive service management. The Service Management Layer in MiSCi platform
facilitates bi-directional integration between agents and cloud
services [37], and Rimware emphasizes structured service
organization [40]. S2NetM automated service discovery and
composition within the SIoT network [41], and WeValue
integrated lifecycle management, value agents, and contracts
for collaborative tasks [49].
5) CONTEXT MANAGEMENT
In smart city middleware, context management emerges as
an essential functional requirement, facilitating real-time
adaptability and responsiveness. FIWARE, for example,
centralizes this capability with its Orion Context Broker, which manages real-time context information [30].
FogFlow showcases a more intricate design, incorporating
federated brokers, orchestrating data flow, caching entity
views, and serving context updates across various cloud and
edge nodes [33]. The Context-Awareness Layer in MiSCi
addresses context discovery, modeling, reasoning, and distribution [37]. S2NetM emphasizes real-time decision-making
through its Context Management component [41]. SGeoL
collaborates with FIWARE’s Orion Context Broker, employing the NGSI-LD protocol and enhancing it with a city model
knowledge base [18]. Finally, the Smart Computing Layer in
SOUL notably uses the Context Converter and Context Analyzer to process raw data, backed by cloud computing [48].
6) EVENT AND ALERT MANAGEMENT
Middleware should be capable of identifying specific events
or patterns within incoming data streams and be equipped to
promptly trigger relevant alerts or initiate appropriate actions
in response to such detections. The subsequent examples
illustrate how the examined solutions handle this requirement. CityPulse focuses on event detection, crucial for
informed decision-making in urban environments [28]. Civitas utilizes event-based communication, optimized through
geopositional and time tagging, ensuring precise synchronization and delivery [29]. MiSCi integrates a comprehensive
system spanning smart objects, semantic event identification,
and predictive monitoring, highlighting the intricate nature
of event management [37]. The SEDIA platform employs
a combination of coroutines, a Message/Event Broker, and
semantic reasoning to efficiently manage events and detect
crucial data anomalies [42]. Also the Event Broker in SmartSantander facilitates a distributed ‘Event Bus’, connecting
all testbed management components through a topic-based
publish-subscribe model, ensuring asynchronous and distributed event handling [46].
7) RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
Resource management in smart city middleware involves not
only the optimal allocation of computational resources but
also the efficient management of physical and logical entities
that constitute the city’s infrastructure. This optimal allocation and efficient management is crucial for ensuring the
uninterrupted and efficient performance of all services, ultimately enhancing the overall responsiveness and reliability
of smart city systems. AMF-CPS middleware, for example,
relies on concurrent and parallel processing by allocating
computing and storage resources from a distributed environment to provide in-time responses for user queries [27].
The FogFlow framework vertically partitions infrastructure
resources into cloud, edge nodes, and devices [33]. This
enables computationally intensive tasks to be processed on
cloud servers, while tasks like stream processing are moved
to edge nodes; it operates across these geo-distributed, hierarchical, and heterogeneous resources, which may possess
either both computation and communication capabilities or
only one of them. On the other hand, the InterSCity platform
involves the manipulation of city resources, where a city
resource is a logical concept that encapsulates a physical
entity that makes up the city, such as cars, buses, traffic lights,
and lampposts [35]. Similarly, in the context of resource
management in CityPulse, a resource is considered a Data
wrapper [28].
8) APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT, DEPLOYMENT AND
MANAGEMENT
Middleware in smart city ecosystems should provide a
robust framework for the seamless development, deployment,
and life-cycle management of applications. CityPulse [28],
for example, offers component-specific APIs, emphasizing

solutions.
C. SUMMARY
In addressing the research question regarding the requirements of smart city middleware, our analysis, as outlined
in Table 3 and Table 4, identifies a core set of both functional and non-functional features. These findings offer a
comprehensive overview of what an ideal smart city middleware should encompass.
Among the functional requirements, data management,
which includes Data Collection, Integration, Storage,
Retrieval, and Data Processing, stands out as a foundational element in almost all middleware solutions. Service
Management and Context Management further emphasize
the importance of orchestrating services and understanding
the context of data, ensuring that services remain agile
and pertinent to evolving smart city contexts. Event and
Alert Management, Resource Management, and Application
Development, Deployment and Management are also integral, each being featured in a majority of the solutions. While
Analytics and Reporting and IoT Management are present
in a smaller subset, their importance within the smart city
framework cannot be understated since they form the backbone for informed decision-making and seamless integration
of a multitude of interconnected devices, respectively.
Regarding the non-functional requirements Scalability,
Interoperability, Security and Privacy, and Distributed Processing are some of the predominant requirements across
multiple middleware solutions, emphasizing their criticality in smart city contexts. Additionally, Configurability,
Real-time Data Handling, Adaptability, Resilience and Faulttolerance, User Interface, and Documentation Quality also
emerge as significant features, though their presence varies
across different middleware platforms.
Collectively, the functional and non-functional requirements detailed in Table 3 and Table 4 encapsulate the
multifaceted roles smart city middleware plays in facilitating cities to be adaptive, efficient, and enabling cities to
meet contemporary urban demands effectively. Notably, solutions like CityPulse [28] and FIWARE [30] exhibit a broad
spectrum of these requirements, emphasizing their comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges of smart city
ecosystems.
V. DESIGN AND PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS
A. ARCHITECTURAL STYLES
An architectural style of a system determines its core structure, the relationships of its components, and its design
evolution principles. The following sections introduce the
architectural styles observed in the reviewed middleware
solutions. Table 5 provides a summary of the primary features
of these architectural styles, listing both the benefits and
challenges associated with each style.
1) SERVICE-ORIENTED ARCHITECTURE
SOA is a prevalent architectural style among the smart city
middleware solutions examined [34], [36], [38], [40], [46],
[48]. It facilitates the integration of various services, devices,
and applications, regardless of the underlying technology,
platform, or vendor, thereby promoting interoperability. Services can be dynamically discovered and accessed over a
network, facilitating the integration of new services and
TABLE 3. Functional requirements for smart city middleware.
devices without significant changes to the existing system.
Furthermore, services provide functionalities abstracted from
the underlying implementation details, making it easier for
developers to use and combine services without deep knowledge of their inner workings. Moreover, the modular design
enhances maintainability and flexibility by enabling updates,
replacements, or maintenance of individual services without impacting the entire system. On the other hand, the
modularity and flexibility of SOA can result in increased
complexity in the system’s design, development, and management. Communication overhead between services over a
network can lead to increased latency, a concern for timesensitive applications. Additionally, exposing services over
a network broadens the attack surface, necessitating careful
design and implementation of security measures.
2) DISTRIBUTED ARCHITECTURE
Distributed architecture can enhance the functionality of
middleware solutions by enabling peer-to-peer interaction,
decentralized control, and fault tolerance as demonstrated
by middleware solutions like SGeoL [18], S2NetM [41] and
SmartCityWare [45]. It can lead to better performance as
the load is distributed among all the nodes or components,
and there is no single point of failure [33], [42]. However,
increased communication overhead can be a concern. The
architecture allows for horizontal scalability, which is particularly important for smart city applications that may involve a
large number of nodes or components[28]. The decentralized
nature of the architecture can positively impact the robustness
and flexibility of the system. However, it also comes with
challenges related to complexity, consistency, interoperability and security.
3) MICROSERVICES
Microservices model is an evolution of the SOA model that
is characterized by the development of small, independent,
and deployable services, with each microservice running
in its own process and communicating with others using
lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP API or a messaging queue [90]. While SOA and microservices share many
principles, the microservices model emphasizes fine-grained
services, independent deployment, and decentralized governance, setting it apart as a distinct architectural paradigm.
Among the strengths of this architectural style, resource
optimization and system performance are notably enhanced
by the ability to scale individual services independently.
This granular level of scalability not only optimizes resource
utilization but also contributes to a more resilient system
architecture, where the deployment and updates of services
can occur independently of one another. Yet, the increased
TABLE 4. Non-functional requirements for smart city middleware.
complexity of managing multiple services can be a significant
trade-off. Middleware solutions like FIWARE [30], InterSCity [35] and Snap4City [47] have adopted this architectural
style, integrating tools that simplify the management, monitoring, and orchestration of the developed microservices.
4) AGENT-BASED ARCHITECTURE
Agent-Based Architecture (ABA) is characterized by the
use of intelligent agents, which are software entities that
can make decisions autonomously, interact with each other,
and adapt to changes in the environment [91]. ABA inherently enhances functionality by creating a system capable
of autonomously adapting to operational changes or new
requirements. Despite the potential for increased latency
and overhead due to agent communication and coordination, the decentralized structure of ABA distributes the
load across multiple agents, potentially enhancing overall
performance. This decentralized nature also lends itself to
horizontal scalability, as adding new agents does not drastically alter the existing system. However, this approach also
brings increased complexity and security concerns, requiring meticulous attention to non-functional requirements like
security, maintainability, and robustness. AMF-CPS is an
example of middleware that follows the ABA [27]. It maintains an agent repository to generate agents, ensuring reliable
service response and request handling for application layer
users. Another instance of middleware adopting the ABA
is WeValue [49], where a ‘Value Agent’ actively represents
a stakeholder. This agent participates in task matching and
orchestration processes, working to identify, negotiate, and
approve appropriate task compositions. The MiSCi middleware is also aligned with the ABA approach [37].
5) BLOCKCHAIN-BASED ARCHITECTURE
Blockchain-Based Architecture (BBA) is a decentralized system [84]. Instead of relying on a single central authority or
location for data storage, the ledger in BBA is distributed
across a network of participating nodes. BBA has the potential to enhance the functionality of middleware solutions in
smart city applications by facilitating transparent, secure,
and automated transactions through mechanisms like smart
contracts [26]. This fosters trust among different smart city
stakeholders. On the other hand, the significant computational power needed for Blockchain transactions can affect
performance, especially in applications that demand realtime responses. Additionally, scalability can be a concern,
as the computational demands typically increase with the
Blockchain’s size. The WeValue middleware examined in this
study is a case of BBA [49]. WeValue operates based on a
Blockchain-based smart contract that formally specifies the
TABLE 5. Comparison of the different architectural styles in middleware
solutions.
agreement for a collaborative activity, encoding contractual
obligations, rewards, and penalties.
6) HYBRID ARCHITECTURE
A hybrid architecture offers significant flexibility as it permits the integration of different architectural styles, thereby
leveraging the benefits of each [92]. Such a design can be
customized to address the unique needs and specifications
of a smart city middleware solution. However, the design
and implementation of a hybrid architecture can be more
intricate. It necessitates a profound understanding of the distinct styles being integrated and their potential interactions.
In this study, two cases were identified that adopt a hybrid
architecture. The MiSCi middleware integrates both SOA
and ABA [37], whereas WeValue integrates Agent-based
approaches with BBA-centric contracts [49]. Another mixed
instance is FIWARE [30], which melds SOA with microservices, though these operate under the same guiding principle.
B. PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS
A middleware aims to provide a suite of programming
abstractions that facilitate software development, especially
when there is a need to integrate and establish communication
among heterogeneous components. The subsequent sections
delve into the programming models discerned in the reviewed
middleware solutions.
1) SERVICE-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
Service-oriented programming often arises naturally from
adopting a service-oriented architecture, though it can also
manifest other architectural styles such as ABA. In this
programming paradigm, applications are structured as a
collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable
services, exemplifying modularity. A middleware solution
can furnish developers with a suite of services to aid in
application development. For instance, AMF-CPS provides
services facilitated by a collection of specialized agents,
offering specific functionalities such as resource allocation
and scheduling [27]. FIWARE provides a set of services
(or microservices) that developers can use to manage data,
devices, security, and other aspects of their applications [30].
Similarly, SmartCityWare provides core services (e.g., invocation, location-based, fault-tolerant, and security services)
to effectively build smart city applications [45].
2) DATA-CENTRIC PROGRAMMING
Data-centric programming offers a high-level abstraction
centered on data and its flow through the application, rather
than the control flow [93]. This abstraction encapsulates
several programming models: processing data as it becomes
available, handling continuous streams of data, and modeling
applications as directed graphs that depict the flow of data
between operations. Key facets of this abstraction include:
• Data Stream Programming: Focuses on real-time or
near-real-time processing of continuous data streams.
• Data-Driven Programming: Emphasizes processing data
as it becomes available, without necessarily involving
real-time processing.
• Dataflow Programming: Concentrates on modeling the
application as a directed graph of the data flow between
operations, promoting modularity, parallelism, and facilitating understanding of the data flow.
These aspects offer a unified perspective adaptable to a variety of specific requirements and use cases. For example,
the CityPulse platform provides services for collecting, processing, and analyzing data streams in real-time, facilitating
the development of applications focused on real-time data
stream processing [28]. Similarly, the SOUL middleware
adopts a data stream reasoning model, which was implemented using real-time big data processing technology [48].
On the other hand, Snap4City adopts a data-driven programming model for creating IoT-based applications [47].
An enhanced form of the dataflow programming model is
proposed by FogFlow [33]. Specifically, it introduces special
operators based on NGSI to augment the traditional dataflow
programming model, thereby enabling more efficient fog
computing.
3) EVENT-DRIVEN PROGRAMMING
The event-driven programming model is based on the concept
of event listeners and event handlers [94]. The middleware
can provide a set of events (e.g., data received, device status changed, etc.) and allow developers to define handlers
for those events. This approach is particularly suitable for
applications that need to respond to real-time changes in the
environment. Additionally, the suitability of this paradigm
for smart city applications is emphasized by its inherent
capabilities, including efficient resource utilization, enhanced
modularity and maintainability, seamless integration of heterogeneous systems, and support for an enhanced user
interaction experience. As an anticipated consequence, many
of the middleware solutions examined in this study, including
Civitas [29], LinkSmart [36], SEDIA [42], and SmartSantander [46], have embraced this model.
4) MASHUP
The Mashup model involves combining data, presentation,
or functionality from two or more sources to create new
services [95]. The middleware can provide APIs and tools
for accessing and integrating data and services from various
sources, enabling developers to create mashup applications
that combine and reuse data and services from multiple
sources. The SGeoL platform exemplifies a mashup application development approach, evident from its integrative
and composite nature [18]. It facilitates the combination of
diverse functionalities like layer creation, geographic querying, and data visualization into a single, unified interface,
making it characteristic of web mashups. Moreover, with
the provision of high-level RESTful APIs, developers can
seamlessly combine content from multiple sources, thus
creating integrated applications. OpenIoT also supports a
mashup approach, offering a zero-programming environment
through a set of visual tools that streamline the development process [38]. The WeValue platform seamlessly merges
distinct client-side and backend components, demonstrating the integration characteristic of a mashup development
approach [49].
C. SUMMARY
Table 6 offers a comprehensive overview of the diverse architectural styles and programming paradigms embraced by the
surveyed smart city middleware solutions. Recognizing that
architectural classifications can vary based on distinct perspectives, it becomes evident that no singular classification
scheme is universally applicable. Given this context, this
study emphasizes the most salient architectural characteristics to categorize the solutions.
While Distributed and Service-Oriented architectures
appear to be prevalent choices, Agent-Based and Microservices architectures are also notably represented. In contrast,
Blockchain-Based architecture remains a more exploratory
approach but holds promising potential for future platforms in
the smart city domain. Hybrid architectural styles, such as the
combination of Service-Oriented with Microservices (as seen
in FIWARE) or Blockchain-Based with Agent-Based (as in
WeValue), suggest a move towards leveraging the strengths of
multiple paradigms for enhanced functionality and flexibility.
In terms of programming models, there is a clear trend
towards Service-Oriented approaches, with many middleware solutions also incorporating Event-Driven and DataCentric models. This mix indicates a need for versatile
middleware capable of handling diverse data types and flows
in real-time smart city scenarios. A few platforms, like SGeoL
and WeValue, also adopt the Mashup model, reflecting the
perspective that integrating diverse data sources and services
seamlessly is an efficient approach to support the development of smart city applications.
Table 6 highlights also the expansive application range
covered by these middleware solutions. They span a variety
of sectors, from simulations, smart energy, and smart mobility
to environmental monitoring, smart government, and intelligent traffic management. Notably, middleware platforms like
FIWARE, OpenIoT and SmartSantander exhibit a broader
adaptability, catering to an extensive array of smart city
sectors.
VI. CHALLENGES AND OPEN ISSUES
In this section, the primary challenges associated with using
middleware solutions in building smart city applications are
discussed, as identified by the reviewed literature. Each
highlighted challenge represents an open issue that warrants
further investigation and holds significant promise for future
research.
A. INTEROPERABILITY AND STANDARDIZATION
Given the diverse array of systems, protocols, and standards
in smart cities, achieving seamless integration remains a
significant challenge [96]. Among the smart city middleware solutions examined, SGeoL [18], SNetM [41], and
SMArc [44] stand out as characteristic examples that attempt
to leverage Semantic Web technologies and Ontologies to
tackle the problem of heterogeneity; however, achieving a
universal semantic understanding across diverse systems and
maintaining up-to-date ontologies in rapidly evolving urban
environments pose persistent obstacles [19].
On the other hand, many technology providers offer proprietary solutions with their own set of standards and protocols.
Middleware must bridge the gap between these proprietary
solutions and open standards to achieve a cohesive smart city
ecosystem. Therefore, while solutions like FIWARE [30] and
OpenIoT [38] aim for open standardization, they must also
consider integrations with vendor-specific solutions.
Devices in smart cities might communicate using a
plethora of protocols like MQTT, CoAP, HTTP/HTTPs,
Zigbee, and LoRaWAN [51]. Middleware solutions face the
challenge to understand and translate between these protocols, ensuring seamless data flow. For instance, the SEDIA
platform proposes the use of Protocol Translation Gateways
to convert the data into a format that the middleware can
TABLE 6. Summary of design and programming paradigms in smart city middleware.
understand [42]. However, implementing and maintaining
these gateways introduces complexities, can impact real-time
data processing, and requires constant updates to adapt to
emerging communication standards.
Furthermore, many cities have older, legacy infrastructure
systems that weren’t originally designed for modern interconnected environments [99]. Integrating these systems with
newer technologies without compromising their operations is
an additional complex challenge.
B. SCALABILITY
Platforms such as FogFlow [33] and InterSCity [35] are
designed with scalability in mind, but there are always
trade-offs between scalability and other attributes. For
instance, performance is one such attribute that can be compromised as systems scale [97]. As they grow, systems may
experience increased latency or reduced throughput. In such
scenarios, managing thousands of simultaneous device connections could lead to slower response times, which in turn
could affect real-time decision-making processes crucial for
specific smart city operations.
Resource management is another relevant attribute [98].
As more devices are added, efficient allocation and utilization of resources, including computational power, memory,
and bandwidth, become more complex and crucial. More
devices mean more network traffic. Middleware solutions
must optimize data transmission to prevent network congestion and ensure timely delivery of critical information.
In this context, SEDIA employs Adaptive Data Rate (ADR)
and task scheduling to ensure efficient communication under
extreme conditions[42]. However, consistently achieving this
balance, especially during peak data traffic or in situations
of sudden influx of data, remains a challenging endeavor
for most middleware platforms. Even with workload management strategies, there is a constant need for real-time
adjustments and monitoring to maintain efficient communication throughout the smart city infrastructure [100].
While cloud infrastructure is utilized by the vast majority
of the examined middleware solutions to achieve scalability,
it also entails cost implications, as suggested in SmartCityWare [45]. As usage increases, so do operational costs, which
can be a limiting factor for many city administrations.
Building on these scalability considerations, Dew/Mist
Computing emerges as a further evolution in the domain [101],
[102]. It focuses on leveraging ubiquitous mobile devices
for distributed processing, thereby expanding the scope
and capabilities of smart city middleware solutions. This
self-sustaining computing infrastructure taps into the collective power of distributed devices, accommodating both
real-time and batch processing. This approach offers a
cost-effective solution to the data management challenges of
smart cities, potentially mitigating issues related to network
congestion and the high operational costs associated with
cloud infrastructure, as highlighted in SmartCityWare.
C. SECURITY AND PRIVACY
The challenge of ensuring security and privacy in the realm
of smart city middleware is multifaceted, involving both
technical and socio-organizational dimensions [20]. Even as
middleware solutions like Rimware [40] and Snap4City [47]
may employ state-of-the-art encryption protocols to safeguard data during transit, the increasing sophistication of
cyber-attacks requires constant awareness and adaptation.
As seen with middleware solutions like S2NetM [41], there
is an ongoing need to ensure encryption methodologies
can withstand novel decryption techniques and brute-force
attacks.
Protecting individual identities and sensitive information
necessitates the anonymization or aggregation of data before
its use in broader applications or analytics [103]. Middleware
solutions such as GAMBAS [34] and SmartCityWare [45]
emphasize the need for advanced techniques to ensure that
individual data points in aggregated datasets cannot be
reverse-engineered.
In urban settings, navigating data privacy challenges
requires middleware solutions to balance technical data
protection with ethical considerations and adhere to regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
in Europe [104]. Furthermore, as civic bodies and stakeholders push for more transparent governance, there is
an increasing demand for middleware that can seamlessly
integrate privacy-preserving measures without compromising the functionality or user experience of smart city
applications [105].
D. CONTEXT MANAGEMENT
Context acquisition, modeling, reasoning, and distribution
in the realm of a smart city present significant challenges
for middleware solutions due to the size and complexity
of data sources and the need for real-time, adaptive, and
accurate interpretations [106]. S2NetM [41], for example,
examines the challenges associated when converting raw
context data into actionable knowledge. This requires exploring interpretation mechanisms like rule-based reasoning,
ontology-based approaches or more advanced machine learning techniques to specify suitable interpretation methods and
reasoning/aggregation mechanisms aligned with the context
model’s capabilities [106]. On the other hand, FogFlow [33],
explores various methods to ensure the distribution of context
information, including proximity-based and node-grouping
approaches. Challenges related to context distribution include
the stability and coherence of the data as it is distributed
across nodes, such as determining the information’s validity
over time and handling potentially conflicting data from multiple observing nodes [107].
SGeoL advocates that a unified city model is required
to facilitate the representation, manipulation, comprehension, and integration of heterogeneous context data [18].
Such a model faces challenges in scalability, managing
temporal and spatial dynamics, ensuring data integrity, promoting semantic understanding, and maintaining privacy and
security [17], [97].
E. BIG DATA MANAGEMENT AND STORAGE
With the vast amounts of data generated in smart cities,
efficient data storage, retrieval, and processing become
critical [63]. Platforms such as CityPulse [28] and SmartCityWare [45] have attempted to provide effective data management strategies. However, there are several associated
challenges that platforms need to address [108]. For example,
managing data quality is pivotal for effective big data management and storage, given the diverse sources of data and the
immediacy of data-driven decisions impacting citizens [38],
[109]. Addressing challenges like noise, inconsistencies,
timeliness, and scalability in data, while ensuring its verification and traceability, is essential to maintain the efficacy of
smart city solutions and retain citizens’ trust.
Moreover, the increasing volume and complexity of
geospatial data from diverse sources pose significant challenges in storage, real-time processing, integration, and
visualization [110]. Middleware solutions like SGeoL [18]
and SEDIA [42], which have demonstrated the use of geospatial data in smart city applications, underline the need to
address these complexities to ensure the efficient, secure, and
accurate delivery of critical geographic information across
various application domains.
Designing smart city services from urban big data involves
intricate challenges, from managing diverse data sources
and ensuring real-time processing to adopting user-centric
designs for efficient information delivery [111]. Key considerations include data standardization, scalable processing,
structured storage, visualization techniques, multi-platform
accessibility, and the maintenance of security and privacy,
as highlighted by the CityPulse [28] and LinkSmart [36]
cases.
F. RESILIENCE AND FAULT TOLERANCE
To enhance fault tolerance, middleware solutions often adopt
a distributed architecture, leaning heavily on cloud infrastructures to provide fault-tolerance services as in the case of
SmartCityWare [45] and SmartSantander [46]. Yet, merely
having a distributed framework is insufficient. Methods and
mechanisms are essential to bolster resilience and faulttolerance [112]. For example, reactive methods are required
such as: data replication to ensure data availability even when
certain nodes fail; load balancing to avoid overburdening
particular nodes; task resubmission to guarantee the completion of critical tasks; or checkpointing to allow the system
to return to a safe state post-failure. Furthermore, proactive methods can be employed to introduce more foresight
such as: self-healing capabilities to automatically detect and
fix faults [113]; preemptive migration to shift tasks from
potentially failing nodes [114]; or fault prediction through
using patterns to anticipate and prevent future issues [115].
Going a step further, resilient methods employ machine learning, particularly reinforcement learning, to interact with the
environment and dynamically adapt fault-handling strategies [116]. This learning-oriented approach can enhance the
middleware’s ability to cope with unexpected challenges
efficiently.
G. QUALITY OF SERVICE
Quality of Service (QoS) stands out as a critical parameter in
the design and implementation of smart city services [117].
QoS encompasses various parameters, including real-time
services, SLAs (Service Level Agreements), and other metrics to ensure that services meet the desired performance
and reliability standards. For example, middleware solutions
such as CityPulse [28] and SOUL [48] have emphasized the
processing of data in real-time to support applications like
traffic management or emergency response. However, realtime services require middleware to process, analyze, and
deliver data with minimal delay. This is particularly challenging given the diverse and massive amount of data that smart
cities generate. Furthermore, to maintain QoS middleware
must adapt to dynamic resource demands, especially during
data surges, and address network variabilities by potentially
rerouting data or using backup channels [118].
Ensuring SLAs poses significant challenges [25]. SLAs
in smart cities necessitate middleware adaptation capabilities
to meet diverse service requirements, such as prioritizing
response time for emergency services or ensuring data accuracy for public transport. This entails attentive monitoring of
performance, with deviations triggering alerts and requiring
corrective measures. Using Blockchain technology, middleware solutions like WeValue [49], which support smart
contracts, can provide transparent tracking of SLA adherence,
potentially reducing costly penalties for violations.
H. ENERGY EFFICIENCY
Particularly for IoT and mobile devices, energy consumption
can be a concern. As indicated in the OpenIoT framework [38], it is important to develop energy-efficient data
collection, transmission, and processing strategies. Middleware solutions need to determine optimal data transmission
frequencies or use adaptive communication strategies as
proposed in the SEDIA platform [42] and to strike a balance between speed and energy, possibly by employing
lightweight algorithms for initial data processing [119].
Dynamic energy management in smart cities involves intricate challenges, including monitoring real-time energy usage
of diverse devices and adapting to the unpredictable urban
environment. Strategies like energy-aware task scheduling,
energy-efficient protocols, offloading to the cloud, and edge
computing each bring unique benefits and challenges, from
ensuring quality of service and minimizing energy overheads to managing computational demands and transmission
costs [120].
I. EVOLUTION AND MAINTENANCE
Middleware solutions need to support a wide range of applications, from environmental monitoring to smart mobility and
transportation as indicated by solutions like FIWARE [30],
OpenIoT [38] and SmartSantander [46]. Tailoring the middleware to be general enough for various applications yet
specific enough for optimal performance is a challenge
requiring meticulous design and continuous evolution and
maintenance. The dynamic and heterogeneous nature of
urban data sources, combined with the diverse functional
requirements of each application, necessitates the development of modular, scalable, and interoperable middleware
components [21], [120]. Furthermore, middleware solutions
in smart cities should be able to be updated and expanded
without disrupting existing services, necessitating seamless
rollouts of updates and patches [17].
VII. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
Based on the responses to the survey research questions
and the analysis of the 20 middleware solutions, a conceptual framework for smart city middleware has been framed,
as depicted in Figure 2. This framework aims to define the
essential features required for the development of an effective
middleware platform, facilitating the creation of integrated
and scalable smart city applications.
The formulated conceptual framework presents a holistic view, integrating both the functional and non-functional
requirements pivotal for the effective operation of middleware solutions. Alongside these, the framework sheds light
on the relevant challenges, detailing various pertinent topics
that often emerge as obstacles in middleware design and
deployment. The subsequent sections delve into an exploration of these multifaceted topics. The aim is to offer a
clearer understanding of the current landscape and the inherent challenges that developers and city planners must handle.
Furthermore, given that technological advancement is a continuous process, this discussion offers insights into potential
future developments, suggesting potential paths for the continued evolution of middleware platforms.
A. FUNCTIONAL TOPICS
1) DATA COLLECTION AND INTEGRATION
Managing data heterogeneity necessitates normalization
protocols, the adoption of industry-standard models, and
adaptable middleware extensions. To achieve third-party
interoperability, a versatile API framework, comprehensive
documentation, and compatibility with open data platforms
are required. For real-time data handling, middleware should
focus on low-latency processes, ensure scalability, manage
data surges, and integrate automated validation, machine
learning for anomaly detection, and alert mechanisms to
assure data quality.
2) DATA STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL
Adaptive storage solutions are essential, with evaluations
of relational to graph-based databases, and hybrid systems blending various advantages. Maintaining data quality
necessitates automated cleaning tools, real-time verification,
traceability, collaboration with data providers, and consistent monitoring. Enhancements in data retrieval encompass
efficient indexing, in-memory processing, semantic storage,
AI-driven pattern recognition, and specialized geospatial data
management strategies including visualization and security
protocols.
3) DATA PROCESSING
Efficient data management requires dynamic algorithms
for filtering and selection, middleware capabilities for data
transformation and normalization using AI, and robust mechanisms for data fusion without compromising integrity.
Additionally, middleware should offer versatile data processing options, adaptability to changing city needs, and leverage
advanced analytics for optimized results.
4) ANALYTICS AND REPORTING
Dynamic visualization methods should cater to diverse users,
offering real-time urban insights and deep data exploration.
Middleware must offer customizable reporting, combining
templated and user-defined formats, and incorporate predictive analytics with automated alerts for anomalies. It is
vital that middleware embeds AI for robust data analysis,
providing on-the-spot recommendations and understanding
urban situations comprehensively. Collaborative analytics in
middleware should foster multi-entity collaboration, harness
distributed computing, and emphasize data security. Lastly,
middleware should support multiple analytical platforms,
facilitate integration with new tools, and support open standards for effortless third-party interfacing.
5) IoT MANAGEMENT
Middleware for device onboarding should standardize IoT
integration, handle diverse device types, and ensure compatibility with both old and new technologies. It must
also offer remote adaptability, support timely software
updates, and empower devices to self-adjust based on centralized guidance. Continuous device monitoring, full lifecycle management, and predictive maintenance algorithms
are essential in middleware to preemptively tackle device
issues. Additionally, middleware should embrace various IoT
communication standards, facilitate smooth channel transitions, and maximize bandwidth efficiency in connectivityconstrained settings.
6) SERVICE MANAGEMENT
Middleware in smart cities should autonomously detect
new services and devices, use semantic understanding for
contextual depth, and ensure modular application design
through dynamic service composition. Service orchestration mandates protocols for diverse device communication,
scalability for growing city networks, and feedback-driven
real-time performance enhancement. Rapid service deployment, holistic monitoring, and oversight of interconnected
systems are essential for meeting urban demands. Lifecycle
management must cover a service’s full duration, from start
to end, and use contract-based collaboration methods. Lastly,
involving all stakeholders, from providers to citizens, is crucial in the service management process.
7) CONTEXT MANAGEMENT
Turning raw data into actionable insights necessitates processing and quality assurance, the creation of contextdiscerning algorithms, the right blend of interpretative
methods, continuous method refinement, and user-friendly
visualization tools for decision-makers. Distributing context information efficiently calls for advanced data transfer
techniques, maintaining data integrity, systems designed
for fail-safety, prioritized data sharing, and adaptability to
network conditions. In collaboration with experts, a comprehensive city model should encapsulate various contextual
elements, be scalable, handle temporal and spatial details,
provide multi-layered data interpretation, and strictly adhere
to privacy and security norms.
8) EVENT AND ALERT MANAGEMENT
In smart city middleware, efficient algorithms combined with
AI and machine learning are essential for real-time event
detection, focusing on scalability and accuracy. Precise communication for these detections involves middleware optimization, geopositional tagging, and assured timestamping.
Event identification is further refined with semantic tools,
ontologies, and semantic web technologies to deepen context
comprehension. Managing these events optimally demands
distributed middleware solutions like the topic-based model
for resilience and adaptability. A comprehensive alert system
is essential, prioritizing personalized notifications, elevating significant irregularities, and featuring user-friendly
interfaces, potentially augmented with visualization tools,
to ensure rapid decision-making.
9) RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
Middleware design should prioritize adaptive allocation
algorithms and demand a balance between centralized
and decentralized management for efficiency and reliability. Managing diverse computational, storage, and physical
resources necessitates tailored strategies and an exploration
of hybrid cloud-edge computing for task allocation. Stream
processing presents unique challenges, requiring insights into
real-time tasks, understanding the benefits of edge-based
processing, and flexibility in choosing processing locations.
The integration of logical and physical resource management
calls for creating logical resource abstractions. Additionally,
middleware architectures must be versatile enough to support
both resource types while ensuring their synchronization.
10) APP LIFE CYCLE SUPPORT
Smart city application development requires several foundational pillars. A developer-friendly environment is central,
necessitating comprehensive tools, rapid prototyping methods, and adaptable modular designs. Life-cycle management
requires robust version control, proactive health monitoring, and efficient recovery mechanisms to minimize service
disruptions. Decentralized application development requires
collaborative platforms, with an acute awareness of security challenges, especially in open-source environments,
and an emphasis on community feedback. User-centric
designs demand thorough engagement with city inhabitants,
standardized data handling, swift data processing, and userintuitive interfaces.
B. NON-FUNCTIONAL TOPICS
1) SCALABILITY
Balancing scalability and performance centers on employing
adaptive architectures, real-time monitoring, and discerning
the intricacies of centralized versus decentralized setups. This
scalability is deeply intertwined with resource management,
which requires advanced allocation algorithms, anticipatory actions against demand surges, and dynamic bandwidth
solutions to accommodate a growing number of devices. Similarly, as scalability grows, so does the challenge of real-time
workload management, necessitating middleware that evenly
distributes tasks, has failover provisions for unexpected data
inflows, and harnesses predictive analytics. Furthermore, city
administrations should assess the economic implications of
such scalability on cloud platforms, embracing hybrid solutions and cultivating vendor relationships for cost-effective
approaches.
2) INTEROPERABILITY
Achieving interoperability demands adaptive middleware and
cross-domain ontologies for robust semantic comprehension, with continuous automation for up-to-date ontologies.
To bridge the gap between proprietary systems and open

FIGURE 5. Mapping of smart city domains in the explored middleware
solutions.
The open challenges presented in the survey can act as
a roadmap for researchers, indicating the gaps in current
knowledge and technology. This can guide them in formulating research questions, hypotheses, and experiments. Many
challenges in smart city middleware, such as data privacy
or IoT integration, may require interdisciplinary solutions.
Understanding these challenges can encourage collaborations
between computer scientists, urban planners, social scientists, and other specialists. Furthermore, the findings can be
integrated into academic curricula to better prepare the next
generation of middleware developers.
Middleware platforms will also shape co-creation as
demonstrated by the WeValue platform [49]. Co-creation,
in essence, is an initiative that stimulates various parties to collaboratively envision and forge a solution that
holds mutual value. It transcends traditional development
paradigms by actively involving end-users and other stakeholders right from the project’s inception, thereby ensuring
solutions that are more aligned with real-world needs and
contexts. Therefore, co-creation forms a dynamic confluence
of diverse actors including citizens and their communities,

and public organizations, each contributing their unique
perspectives, insights, and expertise. A natural evolution
of this is the emergence of e-Democracy, where digital tools and platforms, underpinned by technologies like
Blockchain, empower citizens to actively partake in democratic processes [122]. Middleware platforms that integrate
such technologies can potentially redefine the landscape of
co-creation in smart cities, ensuring that every stakeholder,
especially the citizens, have a transparent and influential
voice in the evolution of their cities.
B. LIMITATIONS
In the analysis, middleware features and requirements were
extracted from the most cited article of each examined
solution and the respective project websites. It should be
acknowledged that other articles might present different
features. Moreover, requirements, technologies, and other
characteristics explored in the survey were identified as features in middleware solutions when they were explicitly or
implicitly mentioned. If certain characteristics were cited as
motivating topics or earmarked for future work, they were not
included. For instance, InterSCity mentioned sophisticated
Big Data processing and analytics along with improved data
visualization as areas of future work [35]; therefore, these
corresponding features were marked as ‘not provided’.
The survey’s insights, while valuable, are based on existing
literature and middleware solutions. The rapidly evolving
nature of technology means that even recent advancements
might not be represented in the dataset if they have not been
extensively cited or documented. Hence, while the survey
provides a comprehensive overview of the middleware landscape, it might not offer a real-time snapshot of the very latest
developments.
The success of middleware solutions also depends on factors external to their design, such as governance strategies,
financial investments, citizen engagement, and social innovation initiatives [123]. The survey may not fully delve into
these external factors. Economic considerations might deal
with the distribution of resources, investment priorities, or the
economic sustainability of certain solutions. By primarily
spotlighting the technological solutions, there is a risk of
developing a skewed perspective that does not holistically
account for the multi-dimensional complexities inherent in
the evolution of smart city middleware.
