Title: Research on the Use of BIM Technology in Green Building Design Based on Neural Network Learning

ABSTRACT Neural networks have received a lot of attention in recent years. However, neural networks
are rarely used in the construction industry, especially for the risk assessment of new projects such as
green buildings. This paper was mainly based on the theoretical analysis of green building evaluation
and the establishment of green building comprehensive evaluation index system. Based on artificial neural
network, the comprehensive evaluation system of green building projects has been studied. According to the
principle of construction risk evaluation index system, a risk evaluation index system corresponding to green
building projects has been established. According to the established risk index system, the corresponding
BP (back propagation) neural network model was constructed. The BP neural network was learned and
trained by MATLAB (matrix&laboratory) software. BIM (Building Information Modeling) model can
carry the characteristics of building parameters and the characteristics of BIM technology collaborative
design, information interoperability, performance simulation and other characteristics were used. Based
on the information transfer between Autodesk’s Revit software and other analysis software, with DBLink (Database Link) plug-in, Access database, Excel functions and macro commands as the medium,
a green building auxiliary evaluation module based on BIM technology was constructed. According to the
established comprehensive evaluation index system, the software and neural network model were used to
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of green buildings for a green complex building project. The utilization
rate of recyclable materials in the architectural design scheme of this project accounted for 17.66% of the
total building materials. The results of the evaluation show that a green comprehensive building project has
been built in a good grade, which is in line with its actual situation in the green building grade.

I. INTRODUCTION
The increase in the frequency of haze weather has made
people generally aware that air pollution is becoming more
and more serious. The energy consumption and carbon emissions in the process of engaging in construction projects are
a major cause of haze weather. Therefore, the planning and
construction of low energy consumption and low pollution
construction projects are imminent. Green building projects
are in a very complex environmental system in modern
society. The green building project itself also has multiple
indicators and complexity. Therefore, the environmental indicators in the green building evaluation system are composed
of many factors. These factors in turn consist of many factors. There are some commonalities or some associations
among these factors. They influence and connect with each
other, forming a complex built environment system. However, the occurrence and development of the green building
environment system follows the laws of freedom in nature,
forming a dynamic system. BIM technology can realize the
current green engineering construction and reduce energy
consumption.
Green building, a new type of building, meets the requirements of low energy consumption and pollution reduction.
Huang D established an evolutionary game model of green
building demand side [1]. The purpose of Azeem was to
investigate the barriers preventing the adoption of green
buildings in Pakistan and the measures to facilitate this
approach [2]. Darko believed that green building (GB) had
been regarded as an effective means for the construction
industry to achieve environmental, economic and social sustainability [3]. Tam et al. collected the service life data of
wood [4]. Sharma contribution was to develop an original
green building sustainability model that fills the research
gap [5]. However, their proposed green building design
scheme has low utilization rate. This paper introduced neural
network and BIM technology to optimize it.
The development process of neural network is tortuous
with the low tide and high tide of development alternately.
Ko and Chen used neural networks for grasping force-based
manipulation of a multi-fingered arm robot [6]. Zhao and Nan
discussed stochastic neural networks with time delays [7].
Perna and Rocca proposed a strategy for choosing the size
of hidden layers in a feedforward neural network model [8].
He et al. studied the robustness of neural networks [9].
Chen et al. used the radial base function neural network to
neutralize non-linear power [10]. However, the prediction
accuracy of their proposed neural network is not high.
This paper first analyzed and compared the green building
evaluation standards of various countries. Combined with the
current emerging BIM technology, the novel advantages of
BIM technology were obtained through comparative analysis.
Furthermore, the unique advantages of BIM technology were
integrated into the rapidly developing green buildings, which
had specific significance for the research and application
of green buildings. It also promoted the development of
the construction scale and construction level of green buildings. This paper studied the application of neural network
learning and BIM technology. Based on theoretical research,
the application of BIM in green buildings was explored by
combining cases. At the same time, through the application
research of BIM technology in this paper, the application
of BIM in all stages of green building was promoted. The
designed functional space in this paper was 420m2, and 86%
of the minimum daylighting coefficients were higher than
3%. In addition, the minimum daylighting coefficient of the
office and meeting functional space area was greater than 2%.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. SPECIFIC MEASURES FOR THE APPLICATION OF BIM
TECHNOLOGY IN GREEN BUILDING DESIGN
If people want to live in a comfortable and healthy environment, there must be proper landscape and certain greenery for
people to appreciate. Green plants such as flowers, grasses,
and trees are all important landscapes in green buildings.
Nature is inseparable from the regulation of green plants.
Therefore, green buildings have become an indispensable part
of nature. In the outdoor design and construction of green
buildings, environmental damage is inevitable. It is necessary
to properly plant some green plants to improve the environment, maintain ecological balance, and ensure the greening
rate of the site. Through photosynthesis and respiration, green
plants can properly adjust the humidity environment of the
site, which is helpful for thermal insulation and improves
the environment inside and outside the site [11]. The indoor
environment of the building directly affects the living of the
users. In addition, it also partially affects the overall layout
and comfort of the building. The main conditions that affect
the indoor environment of green buildings are: ventilation,
lighting factors and sound transmission. It is necessary to
carry out an effective and more comprehensive analysis of the
indoor environmental quality. BIM technology can not only
combine the temperature and climate of the region, but also
solve the indoor wind direction and lighting problems. In the
design process, according to certain circumstances, appropriate adjustments should be made to the adequate arrangement
of building windows and the reasonable division of rooms,
so as to ensure that the designed building achieves an ideal
state. For the noise, the most unfavorable position of the noise
map is searched. The maximum value of green building noise
is calculated, which is observed whether the relevant code
requirements are exceeded. In this paper, the geometric mean
method (square root method) is used to obtain the weight
value of the corresponding element. Then, the green building
quality consistency test is carried out [12].

The maximum characteristic value of green building is:
λmax =

The green building quality consistency index CI is calculated [13]:
CI = λmax−N (3)
The three-dimensional building established by simulation
covers the basic information of the building. In engineering
design and construction, the relevant requirements of design
and construction are achieved based on the information model
that the internal and external structures of the building are
consistent and mutually perfect. Professionals cooperate with
each other, which can improve the efficiency of work. It effectively reduces the cost of production and ensures that the
project is carried out in an orderly manner. Simply speaking,
BIM consists of three parts:
BIM information technology integrates construction
projects as a whole in a digital form.
BIM technology integrates certain parametric models and
includes model information of actual projects. In the early
planning, operation and later maintenance stages of the
project, resources are shared and information is effectively
communicated to ensure that all kinds of engineering personnel can accurately understand and actively respond to various
building information.
BIM technology enables each participant to exchange,
transmit, check, and modify information at different stages.
Efficient coordination among the various parties is achieved,
which improves work efficiency [14].
The coordination of information occupies an extremely
important position in the construction market. In particular,
the owner and the construction unit, as well as the owner and
the design unit, are always coordinating, communicating and
cooperating with each other. However, in the entire project
operation process, if there are difficulties in construction
technology, it is necessary to organize relevant personnel in
specific technical aspects to organize a centralized meeting
and coordination. In view of the problems in the construction stage, some solutions are proposed to effectively adjust
and correct them. In the case of reducing costs, the problems that arise are promptly taken corresponding remedial
measures [15]. In engineering design, there are often inconsistencies in coordination and communication among various
professional designers, which may lead to collision problems
between related disciplines. For example, when professional
designers such as HVAC equipment arrange pipelines, only
the independent construction drawings of each specialty are
displayed on the construction drawings. There is no single
drawing covering the entire set of construction. In terms
of construction layout, especially pipeline layout, it may be
difficult to control related nodes, the intersection of wall,
which may hinder the layout of the entire pipeline by the
beams of the load-bearing structure. This kind of similar
collision problem is often encountered in construction, but
it is difficult to predict in advance. The solution to this kind
of collision problem is usually solved after the incident.
Therefore, the uncertain factors are relatively large, and it
also brings certain risks. The advantage of BIM coordination
can be used to help solve collision problems in specific construction. In other words, the BIM information model is used
to coordinate and control the collision technical problems of
the participating majors in the early stage of the construction
project to generate coordination data and provide it. In addition, the coordination of BIM can solve technical problems
involving collisions between various disciplines. It involves
the coordination between the relevant arrangement of the
elevator equipment and the headroom of the entire floor, the
rational arrangement of the underground water supply and
drainage pipelines and the coordination between the relevant
design requirements. It also involves the coordination of
the arrangement of fire-fighting piping equipment and other
equipment, and the coordination of the design and arrangement of fire-prevention equipment and space [16].
The normalization processing formula of BIM technical
data are as follows:
xi =
xdi − xdmax
xdmax − xdmin
(4)
FIGURE 1. Green building application technologies.
ytl =
ydl − ydmin
ydmax − ydl
(5)
In the formula, xi is the input value of the network after the
normalization of BIM technology [17].
The green building application technology is shown in
Figure 1. It is necessary to scientifically and rationally plan
the building layout and improve the intensification of land
use. The use of computer analysis and utilization of building
environmental factors such as sunlight, light environment,
sound environment, and natural ventilation that affect buildings can appropriately improve the gross density of industrial
buildings (which refers to the residential building area per
hectare of residential land) and the coverage of public buildings. The coverage rate and gross density of residential
buildings should be reasonably determined on the basis of
comprehensive consideration of the requirements of health
and hygiene, energy saving and lighting standards. It is necessary to develop and expand the urban underground space
and create a three-dimensional space city. Combined with the
environment of the building site, through site planning and
simulation, the architectural design parameters are adjusted to
meet the requirements of the green building evaluation standard for different building types in each region. During the
warranty period, if there is a quality problem in the project,
the construction unit and the material supplier are required to
be responsible for repairs and compensation. Operation and
maintenance activities must comply with the relevant regulations of the government project cost management department,
and be monitored throughout the process [18], [19].
B. IMPLEMENTATION OF NEURAL NETWORK LEARNING
IN ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN
Green building design follows four principles of ‘‘sustainability’’, ‘‘integrity’’, ‘‘symbiosis’’ and ‘‘feedback’’. First of
all, green buildings should deal with the relationship between
man and nature in a scientific and sustainable manner. It is
necessary to satisfy the environmental and material needs of
contemporary people. It also need to take into account the
needs of future generations for the use of resources and the
environment. Secondly, as a small ecosystem, there should
be a high degree of dependence and unity between the whole
and the parts, and between the parts. Any details should
meet the requirements of green building. Thirdly, green buildings cannot destroy the original ecological environment in
this area, which makes people coexist with other organisms.
Taking into account the long-term development, it should
also achieve harmonious coexistence and mutual benefit with
the surrounding environment. Finally, it is necessary to pay
attention to the collection of social feedback on the use of
green buildings for reference and adjustment of design ideas
in green building design [20].
Artificial neural network is widely used in mathematics,
computer, automation and other scientific fields. Experts
have applied artificial neural networks to information processing. An efficient new system has been established. The
artificial neural network is built on the research of the human
brain, which has been fully researched and developed by
experts in various fields. Therefore, it has many of the same or
similar functions as the human brain, which is ‘‘intelligence’’.
The specific characteristics are as follows:
Structural features: Parallel processing of green building data is an important feature of neural networks. Neural
networks are composed of many neurons (the most basic
structural and functional units of the nervous system) connected in various ways to form a parallel nonlinear system.
It has similar functions and efficient computing power to the
human brain network. Distributed storage of information is
another characteristic of neural networks. Information storage is distributed according to how it is connected. When
some neurons in the neural network are damaged, the network
can still run smoothly. This is because neural networks store
information in a distributed fashion [21].
Ability characteristics: Self-adaptation and adjustment are
important capabilities of neural networks. By adjusting the
synaptic weights, it can adapt to changes in the surrounding environment. This is its special ability. By learning
the perception of the external environment, experience and
knowledge are constantly supplemented, and the connection
strength and synaptic weight of neurons are changed, so as to
achieve the purpose of adapting to environmental changes.
Generally speaking, there must be an error F between the
expected output and the actual output of the initially designed
neural network in the green building design operation:
F =
1
2
Xl
k=1
(dk − o)2
(6)
The above formula is brought into the hidden layer,
Then [22]:
F =
1
2
Xl
k=1
dk − f(netk) (7)
When the weights are adjusted, the green building design
error is in the same direction as the green building design
gradient adjustment, so there are:
1wjk =
∂F
∂wjk
(8)
1qji =
∂F
∂Vij
(9)
The determination of the number of neurons in the hidden
layer is related to the complexity of the implication law of
each index of the green building project. It cannot be directly
calculated or determined by scientific calculation methods.
It needs to go through continuous data testing to determine.
Therefore, the evaluation result calculated by the BP neural
network is also an estimated value that is close to the actual
value of green building design. The background of green
building projects, investors’ requirements for the accuracy
of evaluation results and the number of sub-indicators in
the green building comprehensive evaluation system all have
direct and indirect influences on the determination of the
number of hidden layer units. Hidden layers are defined as
layers other than the input and output layers. Each input to
the artificial neural network has a green building design connection weight, which is called a weight (wij). The transfer
function is as follows:
yi = f
X
j
wij − θi

(10)
Green building emphasizes on minimizing the consumption of energy and resources in the whole life cycle of the
building without sacrificing the comfort of the indoor environment. In the whole life cycle of the building, although
the construction time is short, the energy consumption rate
is high. In the later stage of use, the utilization rate is relatively low. However, the consumption time is long. Therefore,
the concept of ‘‘green design’’ needs to involve the whole
life cycle process of the project building. From feasibility
analysis, environmental impact assessment, to architectural
design, construction, to operation management during the
trial period, the recyclability of materials, waste reduction,
and resource utilization during scrapping and demolition,
whether the design in the early stage is reasonable or not
largely determines whether the energy saving in the later
stage of use. Only starting from the planning and design
stage of the building, supplemented by appropriate technical
means and reasonable operation strategies in the subsequent
stages, and continuously improving the building system, can
a real green building be created. However, with the development of society, it is more and more important whether
the architectural appearance is aesthetic and artistic. This
has resulted in today’s architectural forms, which can be
described as complex and varied. Therefore, it is difficult
for even experienced architects to fully grasp the physical
properties of buildings solely by subjective judgment. It is
also difficult for traditional architectural design software to
perform quantitative data analysis on buildings that have not
yet been built. As a result, the building details are constantly
changed during the construction process, and the construction
process methods are constantly changed. The building after
completion is naturally very different from the concept at the
beginning of the design.
BIM is utilized to assist water collection. Water-saving
measures for green buildings include rainwater and greywater collection. In this part, BIM mainly conducts technical
analysis in the form of tabular data. Information is collected
through the BIM model to calculate the amount of rainwater
that could be collected by the existing roof area, as well
FIGURE 2. BIM-based green building evaluation process.
as the water requirements for sinks, toilets, water fountains
and other building facilities. The total amount of recycling is
calculated according to the type of water equipment in the
‘‘water supply and drainage device table’’ output from the
BIM model.
b. The energy model is modeled. It is critical for green
project design to understand a building’s energy needs.
According to the energy load target and preliminary design of
the project, it needs to be tested through BIM. First, a stable
and high-quality model is established, including some basic
conditions, such as: roof and floor, walls connecting the
roof floor. The analyzed area must be within the geometric
dimensions of the building.
c. BIM is used to assist the utilization of renewable energy.
Through investigation, after locating potential renewable
resources, BIM is used to correctly configure the building
orientation. The energy return potential and viability of each
system are calculated. Once the system is established, the
design in this model can be adjusted to optimize the performance of each system.
d. Sustainable materials are used. Even if the design project
does not consume energy, the use of building materials cannot
be avoided. The designer should examine and understand the
materials used to the purpose of each cubic meter of materials
in detail, so as to make material selection decisions. BIM
can combine all stakeholders of materials to determine the
proportion and total usage of materials.
The evaluation information is completely created, saved,
updated and transmitted based on the characteristics of high
visualization, strong coordination, good simulation and optimization of the BIM model. With the help of the BIM
systematic information platform, the whole process of green
building evaluation can be completed on a unified online
platform. It is transmitted in a unified format through the
medium of the Internet, which greatly reduces the transmission of information in the form of paper documents.
The whole process is more compact, concise and efficient. In the BIM-based green building evaluation process,
all evaluation-related information is integrated in the BIM
model. The BIM-based green building evaluation process is
shown in Figure 2.
TABLE 1. Corresponding output form for each grade.
C. GREEN BUILDING DESIGN RESULTS
This paper analyzes the BIM technology and researches
the current green building energy-saving software. Based
on the parameters that can be carried by the BIM model,
a green building evaluation assistant system based on BIM
is constructed. It promotes the upgrading of green building evaluation methods from inefficient and low-accuracy
manual calculation and expert subjective evaluation to
high-efficiency and standardized information technology.
At the same time, it provides better optimization means for
each stage of green building design. This article is related to
the risk coefficient when evaluating the risk. Each set of data
has a corresponding actual evaluation. The evaluation levels
of the risk coefficient are: first, second, third, fourth, and fifth.
The corresponding output form of each grade is shown in
Table 1.
The input mode of the network is determined according to
the five evaluation states. Here, the output can be expressed
in the form of Table 1. The BP neural network established
here is a 24∗46∗6 model, and the output results are actually
five. The data corresponding to each output value is compared
with the above risk vector to find the vector component that
is closest to 1. The corresponding level is the evaluated risk
level. For example, if the output result is (0.019, 0.07, 0.034,
0.05, 0.827), of which 0.827 is the closest to 1, the level corresponding to this value is level five, indicating that the risk
is high. The calculation is realized by MATLAB software.
MATLAB software is used in data analysis, deep learning,
image processing and computer vision, signal processing,
control systems and other fields.
Samples 1-18 are used as training samples, and the remaining 2 samples are used as test samples. The above network
is used for cost prediction to test the prediction ability and
generalization ability of the network. The prediction results
are obtained, and the comparison with the results before
adding the generalization method is shown in Figure 3.
Based on the above analysis, two groups of test samples
are used to test the cost prediction method of BP neural network. Obviously, BP network has excellent characteristics.
By using the modified evaluation function method, it shows
stronger applicability than the traditional BP network. The
error value of both sets of test data is less than 11%. The
accuracy of BP neural network is better. The simulation
results of the test samples are good, which lays a foundation
for the actual use of green building cost prediction.
BIM tools parameterize the components of each part of
the building. Parameterized components can carry various
FIGURE 3. Prediction results and comparison with results before adding
generalization.
information. With the help of this information, various
possibilities for engineering applications can be integrated
and calculated. In addition, BIM information model and
related professional energy-saving analysis software effectively transmit information, which also provides an opportunity for the transformation of green building evaluation
to simple operation and scientific quantification. There are
many kinds of software that can do principal component
analysis. One of the most common is the statistical analysis
software SPSS (Statistical Product Service Solutions). It is a
professional statistical analysis software developed by several
graduate students from universities in other countries. The
interface of SPSS adopts the form of table to manage data,
and the operation interface is simple and clear. The general
data interface is adopted, and the system has strong openness,
which can be linked with various office software (word,
excel). This article uses SPSS26.0. The factor process in the
application software performs principal component analysis
on the 7 eigenvector data that affect the cost of green buildings. The calculation results of SPSS are shown in Figure 4.
Among them, the common factor variance represents the
information extracted from the original indicators in this
analysis. The common factor variance refers to the proportion
of the variance of the measured variable determined by the
common factor. It can be seen that in addition to the annual
energy consumption cost per unit building area, the main
component almost contains at least 70% of the information
of each original index.
The green building evaluation criteria are shown in Table 2.
Since its evaluation standard was released and implemented,
it has been rapidly implemented nationwide. It also has representative projects that have obtained the green building
evaluation mark, such as the reconstruction and expansion
project of the National Museum and the Eco-City LowCarbon Experience Center. The new version of ‘‘Green
Building Evaluation Standards’’ has added the construction
management part, which emphasizes that green buildings
should cover the entire project life cycle [23]. However,
in practical application, the goal of meeting green standards
FIGURE 4. Calculation results of SPSS.
TABLE 2. Green building evaluation criteria.
in the whole life cycle of buildings is still difficult to achieve.
Therefore, the green building evaluation standard divides the
certification results into design marks and operation marks
according to the actual situation. Green building labels refer
to information marks that represent green building stars and
have performance indicators, including signs and certificates.
At present, China’s green building market is mainly based on
design signs and is relatively common. However, there are
not many green building projects that have obtained operation
marks, accounting for 6% of all projects.
With the development of BIM technology and the requirements of building energy conservation, Green BIM, which
combines BIM with green building design, has gradually
entered the public eye. Green BIM, which is based on BIM,
incorporates projects related to building energy efficiency
simulation analysis into the BIM operation process. Building
sustainability is achieved through simulation and energy efficiency assessment during the building design phase. Usually,
the computer-aided analysis part of green building design
cannot be realized by a single software. Traditionally, green
building design is often analyzed by a number of professional
consultants on different physical environments of buildings.
The problems of repeated modeling and information transfer
FIGURE 5. Proportion distribution of green building design.
errors are inevitable. Green BIM takes advantage of BIM
technology in information integration. It uses BIM as a
platform to connect the information of each stage in the
design process, and integrates different performance analysis
software. The data integration of BIM technology and the
openness of the platform provide the possibility for a large
number of applications of BIM in green buildings.
The BIM-assisted evaluation system helps to realize the
automatic extraction and calculation of most evaluation information, which greatly saves the labor time. Conceptual design
is the stage in which the entire BIM design scheme is
conceived. Therefore, there are often many different design
options at the beginning of this stage. The conceptual design
determines the basic structure of the design in the next stage.
The conceptual design stage is the most innovative part of the
whole design process, which basically determines the spatial
function distribution of the whole green building, the design
method of structural equipment, as well as the construction
method and so on. Conceptual design works almost entirely
on the knowledge and experience of the architect in conventional design. After the scheme is formed, it is handed
over to other members of the design team for refinement
and analysis. After the scheme is finally formed, it takes
a lot of time to deepen the design and draw construction
drawings. In traditional design, the payment time proposed by
the architectural designer is generally 15% in the conceptual
design stage, 30% in the design deepening stage, and 55%
in the construction drawing and detail drawing stage. The
distribution of the proportion of green building design is
shown in Figure 5.
From the monthly energy consumption changes with reference to the green building model and the design green
building model, it can be seen that due to the large cooling
demand in the cooling season, the electricity consumption
of the whole month also reaches the peak of the whole year
between June and September. The maximum monthly electricity consumption of the reference model is 54,215 kWh.
From the energy saving trend of the design model throughout
FIGURE 6. Monthly electricity consumption by reference and design
models.
the year, it can be seen that the energy saving effect in
the cooling season is the most obvious. Taking August
as an example, compared with the reference model, the
design model saved 14213kWh of electricity consumption
in that month. This is equivalent to saving one-fifth of the
71,020kWh of electricity used in the month. This energy
saving effect is directly related to the ground source heat
pump system with solution dehumidification and higher COP
(Coefficient of Performance) value used in the design model.
This also shows that the use of these two energy-saving
systems can achieve the goal of greater energy saving. The
monthly electricity consumption of the reference model and
the design model is shown in Figure 6.
Traditional green building evaluation work requires a lot
of project data and analysis data. The evaluation process
relies on manual manual calculations. In the calculation process, there are inevitably problems such as lax review of
human operations and calculation errors. The computer-aided
evaluation system can effectively reduce the subjectivity of
manual review. It can accurately judge the consistency of
normative indicators and design indicators, and provide accurate calculation data for later optimization. In the traditional
operation mode, the building information transmission only
occurs in the design and construction stages. In the design and
construction stage, the information of the building is recorded
mostly by design drawings and construction records. This
information has the characteristics of incomplete records and
easy loss. When the building is handed over to the user,
it is generally handed over with the physical object and the
drawings. Structural inspection, pipeline service cycle, maintenance cycle and maintenance requirements are not clearly
required. However, the application of BIM technology can
solve this problem very well. The material volume and other
information are extracted to Excel for processing through
Revit details. Revit software is built for building information
modeling (BIM), which helps architects design and build
more energy-efficient buildings. The information such as
FIGURE 7. Information such as the quality of recyclable materials.
FIGURE 8. The specific distribution of daylighting coefficients of each
type of main functional space on the 4th floor.
the quality of recyclable materials in the design scheme is
obtained as shown in Figure 7. The utilization rate of recycled
materials in the architectural design scheme of the project
accounts for 17.66% of the total construction materials. This
satisfies the requirement of green building evaluation standard that the usage rate of recyclable materials is not less than
10%. It can also be seen from the whole statistical process that
in the green building design based on BIM, the extraction of
building material information fully shows the advantages of
building information design. The Revit platform reflects the
material information of engineering entities as accurately as
possible with its powerful functional advantages. In the relevant design specifications, the minimum sunshine duration of
the building is 1h and the maximum is 3h. In this project, due
to the height of the building and the design of the spacing, the
sunshine duration of each unit building reaches 4h or more.
Therefore, the sunshine duration meets the requirements.
The specific distribution of daylighting coefficients of each
type of main functional space on the 4th floor is shown
in Figure 8. The main functional space (office, conference
room, design room) on the 4th floor of the building covers an area of 650m2. Among them, the area of office and
meeting function space is 230m2, and the minimum lighting
coefficient of 95.6% is greater than 2%. That is, 219.88m2
meets the requirement that the minimum lighting coefficient
of offices and conference rooms in GB 50033 of ‘‘Architectural Lighting Design Standards’’ is greater than 2%. The
design functional space is 420m2, and 86% of the minimum daylighting coefficients are greater than 3%. That is,
361.2m2 meets the requirement that the minimum daylighting coefficient of the design room is greater than 3% in the
‘‘Architectural Lighting Design Standards’’ GB 50033 [24].
From the analysis results, it can be seen that the project
design scheme meets the relevant requirements in the green
building evaluation standard. Besides, the overall level of
natural lighting is good. Because the project adopts the side
window lighting method, the lighting uniformity is poor.
Comparing the simulation calculation results of the main
functional areas of each floor, the lighting distribution of
offices and conference rooms is uneven, and the lighting
coefficient near the windows is high. As the depth increases,
the daylighting coefficient decreases rapidly. The lighting
uniformity of the design room is relatively good. The lighting
effect of the reception area and the corridor area between
it and the design room is relatively poor. Therefore, some
measures have been taken to improve it.
The work mode of the traditional construction industry is
that each unit is a linear work mode, and there is less communication between units. This working mode also brings
a lot of demolition and renovation and cost waste in the
construction process of the construction unit. Although Party
A and the chief architect are responsible for coordinating all
participating units, the effect is not ideal. In today’s increasingly meticulous professional division of labor, more and
more units are participating in the project, and the work of
the responsible sector is becoming more and more refined.
How to efficiently organize these data, it is more and more
difficult to meet the requirements only by relying on the traditional work mode. The introduction of BIM-based technology
provides an opportunity to solve this problem. It provides a
platform for project parties to integrate and share information.
The traditional linear information transfer mode becomes a
mesh transfer mode. Under unified coordination, all units
improve their content on a unified platform. It can stimulate
creativity, discover inconsistencies between cooperative units
early and revise design documents in a timely manner, which
satisfies the timeliness and accuracy of revisions. In addition,
if the information of the old building can be obtained based on
BIM technology in the renovation and reconstruction of the
old building, it also saves the cost and time period for the later
building renovation. BIM technology has been well used in
all stages of the architectural design process and the operation
and maintenance stage after it is put into use. Various national
policies are also vigorously promoting the application of BIM
technology. The evaluation and analysis of green buildings
based on BIM technology and the characteristics of BIM has
far-reaching significance for the accuracy and convenience of
green building evaluation [25].
III. CONCLUSION
Due to the complexity of green building projects and the
inconsistent interests of the investors they represent, it is
particularly important to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of green building projects. The previous green building
evaluation system research is to evaluate the grade of green
buildings through qualitative indicators, that is, the number
of green buildings conforming to the index items to classify
the grades. However, there is a lack of index quantification
and economic evaluation. By discussing the quantification of
indicators, this paper evaluated and analyzed the economics
of green building projects. Based on artificial neural network,
the comprehensive evaluation of green building was studied.
A green evaluation case of an actual project was combined
for research by using BIM technology and its related analysis software. This has proved the role and optimization
direction of BIM in green building design, evaluation, and
construction. Neural networks are widely used. At present,
it has been further applied in many fields, which has made
a lot of achievements. However, in this aspect of the green
building evaluation system, few people use neural networks to
establish evaluation models. This paper exploratively applied
it to the actual case evaluation of green buildings, which has
made a good start. The identification and evaluation of green
building project risks in stages can make the evaluation results
more scientific and reasonable. However, it is still necessary
to learn from experience in practical cases in the future. It is
also necessary to continuously enrich and improve the risk
assessment system to make the system more comprehensive.
This paper has improves the evaluation index system on the
basis of the model established by the predecessors. However,
there is no in-depth discussion of each index factor in the
index system. After the selection of green building indicators
and the determination of the index weights, the appropriate
statistical analysis methods and other mathematical tools are
selected as one of the key directions of future research on the
green building evaluation index system.
