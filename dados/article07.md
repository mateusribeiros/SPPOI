2 RESEARCH BACKGROUND
Emerging technologies are rapidly evolving and have the potential to drive major changes in both society
and the economy. The World Economic Forum [1] defines these innovations as those expected to bring
significant progress and change within five to ten years; they are advancing quickly toward widespread
adoption. Complementing this description, the U.S. National Science Foundation [2] identifies emerging
technologies as transitioning from research and development phases to practical applications, yet
remaining not broadly adopted. This characterization illustrates how these technologies progress from
conceptualization to real-world implementation.
A growing body of literature has focused on identifying the distinct attributes of emerging technologies.
Studies such as [3] and [4] highlight their novelty and rapid growth, emphasizing their potential to
profoundly impact society despite inherent uncertainty. These technologies can drive significant societal
transformation but also pose ethical challenges with far-reaching implications. Their unique attributes
underscore their transformative power and the complexities associated with integrating them into public
services. The literature reveals a consensus on the disruptive potential of emerging technologies. They
have the capacity to transform processes and reshape industries by introducing innovative solutions, yet
integrating them into public services poses significant challenges. Strategic approaches are needed to
address the societal changes and ethical considerations associated with their adoption while ensuring
inclusivity.
One notable characteristic of emerging technologies is their novelty, which introduces new challenges
while also restructuring existing ones across economic and social dimensions. This rapid development
often leaves the regulatory and legislative frameworks surrounding such technologies undefined, leading
to uncertainty regarding jurisdictional oversight [5]. The impact of these emerging technologies extends
beyond a single industry, influencing diverse sectors such as operations management, healthcare,
education, and environmental sustainability.
Emerging technologies present both opportunities and challenges for societal advancement. Ongoing
research is necessary to explore effective strategies for their integration, ensuring that these technologies
contribute positively to societal development while addressing the ethical, regulatory, and inclusivity
challenges they pose. As these technologies continue to evolve, so too must our approaches to
understanding and leveraging them for the public good.
Current literature emphasizes the transformational potential of emerging technologies. However, their
adoption is often more intricate and multidimensional than commonly perceived [6]. A broader
investigation of this process can identify key success factors for generating public value through
technological innovation [7]. Furthermore, many studies rely predominantly on established theoretical
frameworks that utilize conceptual deductive methods rather than empirical data, limiting the ability to
derive concrete, real-world insights [8]. Addressing this methodological gap is critical for understanding
how governments manage technological disruptions [9, 10].
Crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have accelerated technological adoption by reducing
institutional and regulatory barriers that often hinder innovation. The urgency of such events has
compelled organizations and governments to adopt new solutions that might have previously faced
resistance, expediting decision-making processes and enabling the implementation of emerging
technologies at an unprecedented pace. This phenomenon highlights the need for sustainable, long-term
strategies that incorporate technological advancements beyond crisis-driven adoption [11]. Examining
how external shocks reshape technological adoption dynamics is crucial for understanding their long-term
implications on policy and governance.
In the most existing literature, the government is primarily portrayed as a regulator rather than an
implementer, necessitating further inquiry into the practical deployment of emerging technologies within
the public sector [12]. There is limited empirical evidence on the impact of these technologies within 
government settings [13, 14]. Consequently, many anticipated benefits of these technologies in public
service delivery require more rigorous testing and post-deployment impact assessments [15]. Further
studies are needed to understand the adoption processes of these technologies and their impact on
government operations [16-17].
Factors such as openness, transparency, and collaboration are essential for the successful adoption of
emerging technologies [18]. However, there remains a knowledge gap concerning the human aspects of
digital transformation, including the digital leadership competencies required by public sector managers
[19]. Trust-building measures can mitigate perceived risks during the adoption of emerging technologies
in the public sector [20]. Comprehensive studies are required to understand the trust dynamics associated
with technological systems such as blockchain, which often face public skepticism [21]. The security
implications of blockchain technology must be extensively examined before it can be fully leveraged to
enhance smart government services [22].
Furthermore, empirical research on the shift toward digital government remains insufficient,
highlighting the need for policy-informed implementation based on empirical evidence [23]. Cultural
factors also play a pivotal role in the adoption of these technologies; gaining deeper cultural insights can
maximize the effectiveness of emerging technologies across diverse societal contexts [24]. Achieving a
balance between regulation and adoption requires a high degree of sophistication to ensure both
innovation and governance are effectively aligned [25]. Therefore, analyzing the drivers, enablers, and
challenges associated with technology adoption in government services is essential to provide a
comprehensive understanding and develop actionable recommendations for policymakers and
practitioners.

4.2 Case (2): Predict Court Rulings Using AI Techniques
4.2.1 Case overview
The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) is leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance judicial decision-making
through predictive analysis. This initiative aims to streamline judicial processes, reduce case resolution
time, and ensure high-quality judgments. This project benefits more than 2,750 judges and around 27,500
people. The project scrutinizes legal data such as past court decisions, related documents, and other case
details. Judges and lawyers input case information into the platform, which processes it further for insights
and potential verdicts. AI is not meant to replace judges; rather, it has been drawn on to aid them. The AI
process is an optional tool used at a judge’s discretion. This implies that even though AI may suggest
useful recommendations and handle several steps more efficiently, all final decisions are still made by
humans, who interpret each situation.
4.2.2 Drivers
The primary driver for adopting AI techniques to predict court rulings in this project is the significant
enhancement in efficiency and productivity. Traditional judicial processes often take a long time and
require much work, involving extensive documentation and manual case reviews. AI technology can
streamline these tasks by quickly reviewing many legal documents and previous case outcomes. This
reduces the workload for judges and court staff. They can then concentrate on more complex parts of 
managing cases and making decisions. The judicial system becomes more efficient overall, with cases
being resolved faster to cut down the backlog.
Another critical driver is the potential for AI to improve the accuracy and consistency of court rulings.
Cognitive biases and fatigue can influence human judgment, while external pressures can lead to
inconsistencies in decisions. AI systems use data-driven algorithms to avoid these biases and pressures by
providing objective analysis based on historical data, analyzing trends and patterns within judicial
decisions, identifying systemic issues and areas for improvement. This helps ensure that similar cases
receive similar rulings and makes the judicial process fairer and more predictable. This kind of consistency
is vital for maintaining public trust in the legal system.
Another driver was to save a substantial part of budgetary allocations by automating routine tasks and
efficient management of large data volumes. The application of AI can facilitate categorizing and ranking
cases automatically so as to minimize administrative workload, among other benefits like reducing cases
that clerks need to handle at any given time. In addition, AI speeds up case resolution, thus reducing costs
associated with lengthy litigation and court hearings. Savings achieved through these uses of AI are
therefore available to fund other areas within the justice system, such as improving legal aid services or
further investment in technology.
Another driver emerged as better policymaking through data-driven insights and analytics. AI
technologies can handle vast volumes of legal data by extracting trends and patterns that inform judicial
decision-making. By applying machine learning algorithms, AI systems can detect underlying structural
problems in the law which may not be visible through traditional modes of analysis. For instance, AI can
identify disparities in administering sentences or expose biases in judicial decisions and so lay the
foundation for addressing them. As a result, judicial reforms are supported by strong evidence based on
reliable data sources. Additionally, information from AI analytics is considered very significant in
informing policy-making processes. Policymakers are then informed about gaps within existing laws and
regulations and how to align these laws with their respective jurisdictions by interpreting patterns and
trends in judicial decisions.
4.2.3 Enablers
The collaboration between legal professionals and data scientists was an enabler in this case. The legal
experts shared their knowledge of judicial procedures, law principles, and precedent cases to ensure that
AI models meet specific requirements of courts. Data scientists developed algorithms and models for
processing and analyzing legal information. Such collaboration resulted in customizable AI models
catering to the peculiarities of the justice sector, such as the integration of previous legal decisions and
factors considered under statutes. The legal experts also addressed potential bias and ethical considerations
that could have resulted from implementing mistaken measures by scientists regarding fairness or
transparency when making forecasts using artificial intelligence. They also acted as intermediaries
between data practitioners and sources of law-related information, ensuring the credibility of AI
interpretations made through their help. This process also led to continuous refinement of AI models
through feedback, thus enabling them to be flexible to changes within the justice system while improving
their accuracy at every stage.
A supportive regulatory framework from DGA and SDAIA contributed to the successful adoption of AI
in this project. This framework establishes clear guidelines and standards, ensuring that AI systems used
during judicial processes meet high quality, reliability, and ethical standards, thus building confidence
among judicial workers, as well as the public. In order to maintain confidentiality and integrity by
protecting sensitive legal information from breaches and misuse, robust data privacy and security
regulations are required. If DGA and SDAIA develop the legal framework so that it explicitly allows and
governs the use of AI in making court rulings, it will eliminate any ambiguity in law on this issue and
ensure that AI-based judgments are legally recognized within the judiciary. Regulations promoting ethical
AI practices would ensure that AI systems are free from bias and can make fair predictions, making them
more credible for justice decisions. DGA leads efforts at seamless integration with other agencies to ensure
coordinated introduction of AI into the legal system, while SDAIA helps achieve compatibility and
interoperability among these implementations. Moreover, allowing pilot programs to operate under their
supervision will enable these systems to be tested in real judiciary settings, thus generating insights,
identifying challenges, and fine-tuning AI applications before broader deployment becomes possible.
Public awareness campaigns would be useful tools for educating citizens about the advantages associated
with adopting an AI-powered justice system, which is necessary for the development of trust in such
automated judicial processes.
Another enabler for the successful adoption of technology was change management. A structured
transition process was arranged to ensure a smooth transition from conventional judicial methods to AIdriven arrangements, including clear timelines and defined milestones. Continuous support addressed
challenges while comprehensive training programs gave judicial staff the necessary expertise in using AI
tools effectively. The benefits of adopting AI were made transparent through communication strategies
that outlined goals, objectives, and impacts concerning its implementation and addressed concerns about
efficiency improvement rates, accuracy levels, and judicial equity. Monitoring the implementation process
allowed any issues that arose to be dealt with on time, thus making sure the AI systems functioned
correctly. This involved having contingency plans to handle unforeseen obstacles or risks associated with
this innovation to guarantee project success. Change management further facilitated cultural
transformation within the judiciary towards an innovation-oriented mindset supportive of the long-term
sustainability of AI adoption in courts, thereby promoting technological advancements.
National Vision 2030 was a crucial enabler of this development and helped achieve it through various
steps. Vision 2030 highlighted the modernization of the judicial sector and the adoption of advanced
technologies among its strategic objectives. This blend formed a directive for embedding artificial
intelligence in the justice department, with priority attention from top government executives. The
commitment to Vision 2030 led to significant government funding and resources being allocated to AI
projects, which made it possible for sophisticated AI systems to be created and deployed in the justice
system, with access to the high-end technology and infrastructure needed for success.
Effective project management was another factor. Strict quality assurance measures were put in place
by the project management team to ensure that the AI system met high standards of accuracy, reliability
and ethical considerations. Regular testing, validation, and review processes confirmed its performance
against legal and ethical requirements, and thus built trust amongst judicial staff and other stakeholders.
Successful implementation of the project depended on proper allocation of resources, including time,
budget and personnel. To avoid bottlenecks and support all activities sufficiently, the authorities ensured
enough resources were allocated to areas such as AI development, training, and system integration.
Since its commencement, this project has had clear goals, and every stage of AI adoption has been
specified in detail. This made sure that all stakeholders understood what the project intended to achieve
and knew that they were a part of it. The project management team also followed robust risk management
procedures for early identification, assessment, and control of possible risks. This approach included
performing risk assessments at different stages and developing contingency plans for unforeseen issues, so
that the project could accommodate changes or challenges without significant delays in its progress. 
4.2.4 Challenges
The project faced resistance from various stakeholders, including judges, lawyers, and court staff. The
legal stakeholders were doubtful about the reliability and accuracy of AI predictions, with many concerns
being raised over losing human judgment in legal decision-making. Extensive training programs were
needed to overcome this resistance, build trust, and demonstrate the potential benefits of AI. These
included training programs that were developed for judges to learn more about AI and understand its
limitations, stressing that AI was meant to assist judges, not replace them. Transparent communication
strategies proved crucial in addressing concerns regarding the role of AI in judicial institutions. Regular
workshops, seminars and information sessions provided ways for all participants to learn more about the
advantages of AI.
Another challenge was ensuring that the data was of adequate quality. AI systems depend on accurate,
consistent and complete information to work correctly. Historical data in the judicial sector, collected over
many years in different formats, needed to be standardized before it could be used effectively by the AI
system. The project mapped all data sources and then developed a unified format that would help integrate
these different pieces into one whole, thus enabling the AI application to understand and make correct
deductions from this knowledge base and avoid disparities within its subsystems' predictions, making
them unreliable. A need arose for scalability and adaptability, given the increasing workloads within
courts globally in the face of changing laws over time. Designing an AI system capable of growing and
evolving necessitates careful planning, considering factors like the readiness of the infrastructure for
expansion, as well as the ability to update and refine algorithms based on different contexts and different
datasets. Thus, scalability is one of the requirements that ensure success in integrating artificial
intelligence projects while maintaining their relevance intact throughout periods when they are expected
to contribute significantly towards making work easier under various legal systems. This can only be
achieved through continuous enhancements, even after full adoption has been realized.
Another obstacle for this project was legacy systems that were technically incompatible, inflexible, not
scalable and necessitated a protracted transition process. These systems were built on outdated technology
and frameworks that did not support integration with current AI solutions. The project team, therefore,
had to create complicated interfaces and middleware to enable interactions between old techniques and
new ones. This process demanded considerable time and valuable resources; it became impossible to
deploy AI solutions requiring dynamic scaling or robust processing capacities due to ineffective
integration with existing systems. Transitioning from legacy systems to AI-enabled solutions involved
technical integration, moving huge volumes of data, retraining staff and restructuring workflows. Due to
this prolonged transition period, judges’ offices, even now, may experience temporary hiccups, despite
careful scheduling and stage-based implementation to cut down potential disruptions in day-to-day
operations.
4.3 Case (3): Group SMS Management System Using Blockchain
4.3.1 Case overview
The Communications, Space and Technology Commission (CST) has implemented a blockchain-based
platform to manage and regulate bulk SMS broadcasting. This innovative approach has led to significant
project outcomes. Operational costs have decreased by 66%, highlighting the financial efficiency gained
through this technological adoption. Additionally, the time required to process requests has been reduced
by 60%, demonstrating the enhanced operational efficiency and responsiveness of the new system. The
platform has also successfully onboarded 34,000 trusted senders, indicating a robust and reliable network
of users. The blockchain-based system works by leveraging decentralized ledger technology to securely 
and transparently record all transactions related to SMS broadcasting. Each SMS broadcast request is
validated and logged into the blockchain, ensuring that all messages are traceable and verifiable. This
eliminates the possibility of unauthorized messages being sent, as each sender must be a verified entity
within the network.
4.3.2 Drivers
The primary reason behind this project was to improve transparency in communication through managed
bulk SMS. Blockchain technology provides a decentralized and unchangeable ledger where every
transaction is recorded, implying that all messages or information exchanged between the involved parties
are permanently logged and correctly recorded. In this context, any user in the network, be it an employee,
government official, or customer, will have access to the same set of validated information. First, it should
be able to create an indelible record for each transaction, thereby reducing the risks of misinformation and
unauthorized adjustments. This enables all participants in the network to use blockchain as a source of
reliable real-time data on their activities within the communications chain, making it trustworthy and
responsible. It is especially significant in governmental operations, where the credibility of messages and
data is essential for making decisions or communicating with the public. This helps increase reliability as
messages find their way through different stages, thus minimizing chances of either tampering or fraud.
The project was driven by the need to avoid fraudulent SMS messages using blockchain technology.
Unauthorized access and exploitation are common within traditional SMS systems, leading to numerous
fraudulent messages. These unwanted communications may erode customer confidence and cause severe
financial losses. Blockchain technology can solve this problem based on decentralized ledgers and
cryptographic protocols. This mechanism allows every SMS sent over the blockchain-based system to be
authenticated and verified through a consensus technique.; such an approach not only denies unauthorized
access but also makes it practically impossible for scammers to send spam texts since each transaction is
traceable in a transparent manner. By confirming its originality, the messaging platform raises user
reliance on its services, hence securing SMS communications more effectively.
Regulatory compliance is another important factor for adopting this technology. Governments and
regulatory agencies are strict on data management and SMS dissemination to protect consumers' privacy
and to avoid abuse. Failure to adhere to these policies could result in legal implications, loss of reputation,
and infringement of citizens’ data. Companies can easily use this type of blockchain technology to comply
with regulations because it provides transparent and immutable information that is necessary for
regulators. The decentralized ledger will ensure that all communications are securely recorded and
available for audit. This characteristic can be beneficial in meeting compliance requirements since it allows
real-time tracking and confirmation of message delivery. Furthermore, sensitive information from
breaches and other violations of data protection laws will be protected by external security functions
provided by the blockchain system. Thus, organizations adopting this technology will show their
commitment to regulatory compliance, which will aid in building trust between them and regulators or
customers.
Reducing operational cost was another driver for adopting blockchain in this project; traditional bulk
SMS management solutions are usually operationally expensive due to intermediaries' requirements and
the complex infrastructure needed for safe message delivery. These expenses can be a barrier, especially
for small-scale service providers, and they may limit both the scalability and the efficiency of the
communication system. By providing a decentralized platform for message verification and delivery,
Blockchain technology eliminates intermediaries in its network nodes. This simplifies the process, and 
lowers operational costs. In addition, organizations can save on transaction fees and cut down on
complexity by eliminating third-party verification services.
Furthermore, smart contracts using blockchain can automate many processes, leading to reduced
operational costs. These are self-executing contracts with terms of agreement directly written into code;
they execute themselves, enforcing the terms without manual intervention, thereby cutting administrative
overheads. Consequently, automating all these functions improves efficiency and reliability within the
communication system and provides an economical approach to handling bulk SMS services.
4.3.3 Enablers
A key enabler was the DGA's support of the regulatory environment. The DGA set out clear directions and
norms for employing blockchain in digital communications to harmonize the new system within legal
parameters. In this way, this framework created a structured, secure environment for deploying blockchain
technology, thereby mitigating potential uncertainties around the law and compliance risks. These
regulations not only had to comply with security and privacy standards but also fostered innovation and
enabled the adoption of emerging technologies. Regulatory incentives and clear guidelines fostered trust
and dependability among stakeholders, leading more organizations to adopt similar technologies.
Leadership commitment was one of the driving factors that successfully adopted the Bulk SMS
management system using blockchain technology in the Information Technology and Communications
sector. The management has always been committed to leading the project in the right direction, with
adequate financial resource allocation. This led to their active championing of the project and promoting a
culture of innovation and trust within the organization. This high-level endorsement of the blockchainbased Bulk SMS management system accelerated the decision-making process and reduced resistance to
change because employees were confident about the strategic direction that their leaders had endorsed.
This acceptance substantially facilitated the operationalization and integration of the system.
Stakeholder engagement was another enabler for the success of this project. Effective stakeholder
engagement involving government departments, companies from the private sector, end users and
regulatory authorities enabled a holistic approach that eased its implementation and operation. Inclusive
planning and stakeholder consultation ensured the system was designed to meet all relevant requirements
from different actors. Important consultations took place with government agencies and regulatory bodies
regarding compliance issues and legal matters involved in the safe keeping of records using blockchain
technology. Engaging private sector companies in the project allowed it to incorporate advanced
technologies and best practices, thus improving the system’s functionality and effectiveness.
Collaborative decision-making processes involving stakeholders further helped to proactively address
potential challenges and risks. By incorporating feedback from various stakeholders at different stages of
project planning and development, potential issues could be identified early enough for mitigation actions
to reduce the probability of delays or cost overruns. This kind of partnership was key to generating
ownership and commitment among stakeholders, thus anchoring the long-term performance of this
project. Furthermore, continuous communication with end-users, coupled with feedback loops, made it
possible for the system to remain user-friendly while adapting to any changing needs along the way.
Regular engagement sessions, workshops, and pilot testing were some instances where end-users’ realtime responses were used to continuously refine and optimize the system, while also showing how
perplexing an output can become. Moreover, transparent information sharing and regular updates on
project progress helped in building trust among stakeholders. Maintaining open lines of communication
throughout the project execution process kept every party informed about the progress of this initiative;
therefore, clear expectations could be maintained while ensuring everyone stayed focused on achieving 
deliverables set out at the conception stage of this initiative; this transparency was critical throughout the
life cycle so that popular support is retained until completion.
The implementation of the project was further facilitated by interoperability. This involved seamless
integration and interaction between the existing IT infrastructures, various messaging platforms and
systems implemented around different stakeholders. These developments made it possible to exchange
details across different systems, thus improving the overall system performance and user experience, thus
ensuring smooth coordination among government agencies, private sector companies and end-users,
which allowed for real-time updates, consistent data management and streamlined operations.
Interoperability also contributed to scalability, making it easier to add future technologies and other
features without a complete overhaul. Therefore, by enabling the new blockchain system to operate with
the old technologies and processes in a highly compatible manner, interoperability greatly enhanced this
project’s feasibility, user adoption, and long-term success.
4.3.4 Challenges
The complexity of integrating the new blockchain system with existing communication systems was one
of the main challenges. Traditional SMS administration systems were deeply rooted in their operational
framework, which meant replacing them with a blockchain-based system required significant
modifications. Beyond any technological adjustments that had to be made, this integration process entailed
changes in workflows, data management protocols, and security procedures to ensure that it did not
disrupt major existing structures.
The absence of skilled personnel knowledgeable about blockchain technology was another major
challenge. This deficit in the workforce took different forms. First, project managers found it difficult to
hire people with the required skills and experience due to fierce global competition for blockchain experts.
Such high demand meant individuals with these qualifications could demand better salaries and welfare,
thereby overstretching project budgets and making it difficult to attract or keep them as staff. Therefore,
the company had to compete with large corporations with over a few professionals specializing in
blockchain. Long waits were caused during the development stages by slow recruitment processes because
not enough qualified personnel were available for hire.
Meanwhile, within their current IT team, there were wide disparities in knowledge about blockchain
technology, thus necessitating extensive training sessions and upskilling exercises, further straining
already limited resources and timelines. The scheme resorted to seeking help from external advisers, as
well as outsourcing, to offset this shortage; however, such actions created problems in coordination,
quality assurance control mechanisms, and increased costs, among other things. In some instances,
reliance on others resulted in a lack of uniformity or inadequate depth of institutional understanding by
members constituting core teams in different aspects of an initiative at various levels, or across several
organizations working jointly towards achieving common goals in a particular program area. Furthermore,
the inability to retain internal expertise raised questions about the possibility of long-term support of the
system through maintenance activities, upgrades, and troubleshooting without significant numbers being
trained in distributed ledgers; ensuring its security and effectiveness would become complex in terms of
time, while cost implications associated with addressing these concerns called for strategic planning of
investment towards capacity building, in addition to effectively utilizing knowledge contributed by various
outside players to ensure success during subsequent implementation phases, as well as to facilitate
sustainable foundations for wider adoption of blockchain-based systems in future.
The cost of implementation emerged as a challenge. Blockchain technology requires substantial initial
investment in infrastructure, including the acquisition of advanced hardware and development of 
specialized software. Additionally, there were costs associated with training staff to use and integrate the
new system proficiently alongside existing platforms. The financial burden was further exacerbated by the
need for ongoing maintenance and updates to ensure the system remained secure and efficient. These
financial constraints posed a considerable barrier to the seamless adoption of technology, requiring careful
budget planning and resource allocation to address the high costs.
4.4 Case (4): Book Clearances Using AI
4.4.1 Case overview
The Ministry of Culture (MOC) is utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve book clearance and
publishing. The aim is to make the evaluation of book content more accurate and efficient, speed up the
publication process, and ensure the observance of laws and regulations. AI technology has enabled book
publishers to process over 10,000 documents monthly.
AI technology in book clearance publishing works through sophisticated algorithms and machine
learning models designed to help with vast amounts of text. The first stage involves feeding the
manuscripts and other relevant papers into an AI system. These books are analyzed using natural language
processing (NLP) techniques to identify themes, genres, and compliance-related keywords. For quality
control purposes, this AI must assess the content following established publishing norms. Apart from
detecting plagiarized work or offensive text, there may be suggestions for improvements or sections
requiring further human scrutiny. In its earlier stages, automation by AI saves time, effort and costs by
freeing human editors who would otherwise have to go through everything word-by-word before
concentrating on specific aspects of quality. Additionally, AI integrates with current publishing platforms
and databases to create consistency during workflow integration.
4.4.2 Drivers
One driver for adopting artificial intelligence in book clearance publishing was to enhance efficiency and
accuracy in content evaluation. Traditional methods of manuscript reviewing were time-consuming and
prone to human errors. Artificial intelligence offered an automated way of evaluating manuscripts, thus
reducing the time taken to assess large volumes of content. This automated process expedited publishing
and helped improve content assessment, making it more accurate and ensuring higher quality and
consistency in published works. Scalability is another primary driver; the publishing industry's boom in
submissions required a solution that could handle massive operations without compromising quality. AI
systems can process thousands of documents simultaneously, making efficient management feasible
amidst growing demand. The scalability offered by AI allowed publishers to keep pace with new
manuscripts while ensuring constant output and satisfying market needs.
Reducing costs was another leading reason for absorbing AI concepts into the publishing sector; AI
eliminated many manual tasks usually involved in book clearance or publishing, reducing the need for
labor and thereby sharply reducing operational costs. Publishers looking to maximize their budgets and
allocate resources strategically found such cost-effectiveness most appealing. The initial investment in AI
technology was recovered through long-term savings from lower labor costs and higher productivity.
Regulatory compliance was also a key driver behind AI adoption in this domain. The publishing industry is
governed by numerous laws regarding content, copyrights, distribution, etc. AI systems can be
programmed automatically to check for compliance with these rules, avoiding legal issues when releasing
any work. This feature mitigated risks associated with non-compliance and safeguarded the publisher's
reputation. 
The overall motivation for embracing advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence stemmed from a
desire to innovate and modernize. The move towards embracing progressive technologies demonstrated
commitment to being at the forefront of industry developments. Implementing such advanced technologies
made the publishing house attractive to progressive authors and partners and created a culture of
continuous improvement and adaptation.
4.4.3 Enabler
Another critical facilitator was the existence of a robust IT infrastructure. With a strong IT backbone,
characterized by Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), servers, and reliable cloud services, AI could be
seamlessly integrated into existing systems. This infrastructure was essential for handling the
computationally intensive tasks of AI algorithms, facilitating efficient processing of the large amounts of
data necessary for maintaining speed and accuracy during book clearance and publication processes. The
infrastructure also supported storing and managing massive data volumes, enabling continuous AI
learning.
Another vital enabler was the presence of AI experts with knowledge in both AI and publishing. These
individuals provided technical expertise for implementing AI tools and the industry experience to ensure
their successful application. For instance, publishing experts would oversee how AI concepts were applied
to meet editorial standards and compliance criteria while technologists developed and updated the
algorithms. This human expertise was indispensable in fine-tuning AI applications to achieve desired
outcomes, such as improved manuscript quality and faster publication times.
Access to open-source AI tools significantly lowered barriers to adoption. They offered an affordable
way to experiment without investing in proprietary software. The open-source community's contributions
to the development of these tools provided vast knowledge and resources for solving specific problems or
improving system performance. This collaborative approach expedited the adoption process and allowed
organizations to keep up with technological trends, ultimately improving efficiency.
The agility of AI adoption was critical in ensuring success. The project team was able to react quickly
to challenges and opportunities throughout the integration process using agile methodologies. Iterative
development cycles facilitated continuous refinement of this AI system to meet the changing demands of
the publishing industry. Regular feedback loops with stakeholders facilitated timely modifications and
improvements, resulting in a more effective customized solution. Agility practices within various
departments instilled a culture of innovative adaptability within an organization. Through this dynamic
approach, the project kept moving forward and responded promptly to any issues, thus delivering solid AI
solutions that significantly enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of book clearance.
4.4.4 Challenges
Interoperability was one of the main issues faced by the adoption of AI in this project. The AI systems
need to integrate into different existing platforms and databases, which usually have diverse formats and
standards. This complexity arises from publishing companies generally having distinct software solutions
for managing manuscripts, editorial workflows and distribution channels. Extensive customization and
continuous maintenance must enable the AI to communicate effectively with all these systems.
Furthermore, AI should be able to handle numerous file types, metadata descriptors, and data
communication protocols, which is a significant technological challenge. Also, the publishing industry's
lack of standardized data formats exacerbates this issue, making it impossible to develop a one-size-fits-all
solution.
The AI models used in book clearance and publishing predominantly rely on training data for learning
and accurate predictions or recommendations. Nevertheless, the publishing industry has a wide range of 
genres, styles and content types. Thus, because of such diversity, an adaptable AI model is needed that is
capable of operating across various contents. These models are complex since they need a broad scope of
representative datasets encompassing all publication areas. Similarly, the language keeps changing; hence,
any AI model has to be updated regularly. The versatility of these models also depends upon their ability
to deal with nuances particular to given contexts and variations in content (which can be seen as an
ongoing process).
Public perception is another challenge faced by the adopters of AI. Authors and editors, among other
stakeholders in the publishing industry, may feel skeptical or resistant to the application of AI for fear of
job losses, being creatively forced out, or seeing impersonal processes carried out through this automation.
Distilling benefits like increased efficiency, reduced costs, and the conversion of artificial intelligence into
meaningful messages requires careful communication and education. Moreover, public perceptions about
AI are shaped by broader societal attitudes, and media portrayal also affects its acceptance and integration.
Thus, transparent discussions are required about the proper place of artificial intelligence in society, its
restrictions, and the means of preventing unethical or unjust practices. Changing also involves proving
that AI can assist without undermining the human elements of the publishing process.
4.5 Case (5): Smart Transportation System
4.5.1 Case overview

a smart city was significant as it provided the necessary policy framework, funding, and resources that
would aid in implementing such an initiative without any financial or regulatory challenges.
The availability of advanced technological infrastructure and expertise within the city also played a
vital role. For instance, Riyadh has invested heavily in IT infrastructure development and a skilled labor
force, which has created an enabling environment for AI and IoT implementation solutions. The
availability of data centers and communication networks, among other existing infrastructures, facilitated
the seamless integration of emerging technologies. 
Collaborative partnerships with technology vendors and industry experts were instrumental in the
project’s success. These partnerships brought technical knowledge, ensuring the project benefited from
current improvements in AI and IoT. Risk mitigation was achieved through working with experienced
partners, who accelerated deployment, while pilot projects, including proof-of-concept initiatives, acted as
a significant enabler: the city used small-scale projects to test and refine the technologies before their
wider deployment. Consequently, any potential issues were observed in pilot projects, facilitating the
creation of efficient strategies for wider application.
Public participation and awareness campaigns were essential to get support for these changes and gain
acceptance of them. Educating people about what is entailed in smart transport systems while allowing
them to participate actively in the decision-making process builds trust among others, fostering an
ownership spirit among community members, which is very important, especially in overcoming
resistance towards change.
Moreover, regulatory frameworks and standards tailored specifically to facilitating AI and IoT
applications in transportation made the system possible; these have provided specific guidelines to ensure
the safe use of these technologies and that they are implemented effectively so that they do not affect
human health. These frameworks were used for compliance and to resolve any legal or ethical issues
arising from introducing AI and IoT systems in transportation.
4.5.4 Challenges
The project faced some challenges that had to be dealt with for success. One of the major problems
involved incorporating AI and IoT technologies into existing transportation infrastructure. This
necessitated thorough planning and technical expertise to guarantee interoperability between new systems
and legacy infrastructure. The project team bridged technological gaps through the creation of customized
solutions, which facilitated the smooth flow of data across different systems. Additionally, data privacy
and security concerns raised significant challenges. Implementing AI and IoT technologies requires the
collection and processing of huge amounts of data, leading to worries about the privacy and security of
data. Strong security measures were required to ensure compliance with data protection regulations and
safeguard sensitive information. Advanced encryption techniques, together with access control
mechanisms, were implemented by the project team so that they could protect data and retain public
confidence.
Another important concern was the scalability of AI and IoT systems. In light of the growing
population and transportation needs within this city, smart transport systems had to be designed to handle
higher loads without adversely affecting their efficiency levels. Scalability called for optimizing AI
algorithms alongside IoT infrastructure, thereby enabling them to accommodate future growth. Moreover,
resource limitations, including finances and human capital, also posed some challenges. Careful
management of the budget was necessary to ensure that all resources were used effectively. However,
finding skilled practitioners who were conversant with AI and IoT technology proved challenging, since
this skill set is in high demand.
Also, there was public resistance towards changes as well as doubt over these emerging technologies.
Public awareness campaigns were needed so that those with doubts concerning smart transportation could
see its usefulness: this was achieved through engagement initiatives within local communities and other
stakeholders. One thing that became very clear when designing such projects was that people had various
concerns, such as reliability issues relating to safety features regarding privacy in the new systems, which
made it difficult to consider adopting such emerging technology. 
Operational challenges, such as ensuring that AI and IoT systems are maintained and remain functional
continuously, are among the continuing problems. Therefore, the project team has formed a separate team
to maintain and support these systems technically to avoid any downtime. In addition, continuous
monitoring and regular updates have been mandated to update these systems with the latest technical
advancements and security patches.
4.6 Case (6): WTTC'S Global Summit Through Metaverse
4.6.1 Case overview
The Ministry of Tourism (MOT) adopted metaverse technology in hosting the World Travel and Tourism
Council Global Summit 2022 (WTTC) to power its Global Summit aimed at introducing Saudi Arabia’s
Vision 2030 for economic diversification and promotion of cultural heritage. The program was designed to
give visitors an immersive virtual environment with global participants that could be engaged in real-time
experiences. This also attracted significant attention internationally by showcasing opportunities for major
investment in tourism projects, including Neom, the Red Sea, as well as Diriyah throughout Saudi Arabia.
This resulted in participation by twenty different countries, three thousand visitors from all over the
world, and ten diverse sessions which established an extensive platform for numerous discussions,
presentations and networking opportunities within a virtual environment. The technology allowed users
to create digital characters who would navigate around the summit, attending various sessions and
interacting with other participants. For instance, the online space provided very detailed virtual
exhibitions and active debates, just like real-life situations. This conference had many breakout meetings
such as plenary sessions, workshops, forums and webinars held virtually in the Internet space, figure 4.
4.6.2 Drivers
One of the major motives for adopting Metaverse was to improve global accessibility. Many prospective
participants are unable to attend traditional in-person summits due to geographical, financial and logistical
constraints. The WTTC desired to overcome those obstacles by capitalizing on the Metaverse so that a
wider range of people could participate in it. This was an important step towards democratizing access to a
global organization like WTTC where inclusivity and representation from different parts of the world were 
of prime importance. The virtual platform ensured all locations could partake without any problems, thus
incorporating ideas and inputs of various stakeholders into the deliberations and outcomes of the summit.
Furthermore, there was also a clear alignment with WTCC’s sustainability goals. The travel and
tourism sectors have recently recognized the need to reduce their impact on the environment, especially
through the carbon emissions resulting from international travel. The transition into a virtual summit
greatly reduced the carbon footprint resulting from this event, showing the organization’s commitment to
sustainability and setting an example to other industries hosting similar gatherings. While positively
contributing to global efforts toward sustainability, such Metaverse applications can provide an option that
retains the summit’s integrity and impact.
Another key driver was a desire to create a unique and immersive experience for participants.
Traditional virtual conferences usually need more interactivity and networking opportunities than their
physical counterparts offer. However, Metaverse can provide them with a dynamic environment that
closely imitates reality. Attendees were able to take part in real-time conversations, join virtual
networking events or engage with interactive panels, all presented in visually appealing virtual
surroundings. This immersive experience sought to encourage meaningful dialogues and connections
during the summit, adding value for those who attended it.
The need for cost-effectiveness also influenced the decision to use Metaverse. Organizing large events,
including hiring a venue, travel expenses, accommodation, and logistics, has extensive financial
implications. WTTC was able to thus cut these costs significantly by hosting the summit virtually. This
enabled them to use their money more efficiently and invest more in content, speaker quality, and
participant engagement tools. On top of this, the savings on costs ensured that the event attracted an even
wider audience, since participants did not incur travel and accommodation expenses.
Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated why event organizations must be resilient and
adaptable. With the uncertainties imposed by COVID-19 restrictions, traditional face-to-face gatherings
became very difficult, if not impossible. Metaverse offered an adaptive approach which ensured that there
was no break in continuity with respect to the Global Summit, regardless of any physical limitations there
may have been on locations where people could gather. This kind of adaptability was essential in keeping
up with the pace of change during extraordinary times, implying that event management requires creative
methods going forward.
4.6.3 Enablers
Financial resources and investment were also pivotal enablers. Transitioning to a virtual platform required
significant investment in technology, training, and infrastructure. The WTTC allocated resources
strategically to ensure that the necessary technological and human resources were available to support the
project. This financial commitment underscored the importance of the initiative and provided the means to
achieve a high-quality virtual event experience.
The existing culture of innovation within the WTTC and the tourism sector facilitated the adoption of
the Metaverse. The organization's willingness to embrace emerging technologies and innovative
approaches was a crucial enabler. This culture of innovation provided the necessary mindset and
organizational support to explore and implement the Metaverse initiative. It encouraged a forwardthinking approach that aligned with the broader trends of digital transformation within the industry.
An important enabler in terms of the user-centric design for the WTTC Global Summit Metaverse
platform was to make sure that it had an intuitive interface that would allow users to move easily around
the virtual world. They had designed the metaverse platform with a minimalistic user interface, so that
most people could use it without any problems. Users were able to understand how they should interact
with this system thanks to such features as intuitive menus, self-explanatory icons and simple instructions.
Such simplicity allowed them to concentrate on content and networking opportunities instead of
troubleshooting various technical issues. By making usability its priority, the WTTC enabled all
participants, even those who were new virtual reality (VR) to technology, to engage effectively and get the
most out of their experience at the virtual summit.
Collaborating with the tourism industry was one of the things that made it possible for Metaverse to be
implemented at the WTTC Global Summit. These collaborations helped a lot because they ensured that the
platform was modified to meet specific needs and expectations within this sector. This means that by
partnering with different stakeholders, including policymakers, member organizations, and industry
professionals, the WTTC could get beneficial insights, which were used when designing the metaverse
environment according to their needs. This enabled the designers to know which features or interactive
components would likely improve the participants’ experience. For example, stakeholders had mentioned
the need for networking; hence, virtual lounges were created, where people could meet, and chat live.
Additionally, input from tourism practitioners played a significant role in generating interesting content,
such as interactive panels, virtual tours or immersive experiences, which resonated well with the audience.
However, it was not all about getting feedback; it also involved partners actively during the
development and execution phases while working together towards its success, as reported by experts. In
relation to this, planning sessions involved selecting speakers representing different parts of the world,
thus ensuring rich diversity at the summit and creating virtual exhibits.
4.6.4 Challenges
One of the major challenges that were faced during the WTTC’s Global Summit in the Metaverse was to
have a robust technical infrastructure that could handle many users at once. This meant having a platform
that could scale up to accommodate global attendees, who would need high server capacity and efficient
load-balancing mechanisms. In case any infrastructure failed, the consequence could be a crash, which
would lead to disruption of the summit and user engagement; this meant that reliable and resilient
technological solutions were needed.
Incorporating various technologies, as well as platforms, into the metaverse was yet another major
hurdle. The summit required seamless interaction between different VR systems with software
applications and communication tools. This meant that it was necessary for these technologies from
different sources to be compatible with each other to provide holistic and operational user experience.
However, maestro planning was needed, as well as execution, in order not to have any kind of technical
inconsistencies or disruptions within this event, especially when it came to connecting numerous
standards and protocols.
Maintaining attendee attention and engagement over long durations in a virtual environment was yet
another difficulty. Virtual events can be affected by "screen fatigue", which happens when prolonged use
of the gadget causes lower levels of both interest and engagement. For participants to stay interested and
actively involved, the program had to be designed such that it contained regular breaks, different session
formats, and interactive components. It was thus vital for these essential aspects to be incorporated in
designing a schedule.
Addressing technical literacy and comfort with the Metaverse platform among participants was a
significant challenge. Not all attendees would be familiar or comfortable with navigating a virtual
environment, particularly one as complex as the Metaverse. Providing thorough onboarding processes, 
including tutorials, help desks, and user guides, was essential to ensure that all participants could fully
engage with the platform. This required additional resources and support but was crucial for the overall
success and inclusivity of the summit.
Ensuring the security and privacy of participants was paramount. The summit's virtual nature
introduced potential vulnerabilities to cyberattacks and data breaches. Implementing robust encryption
methods and cybersecurity measures was essential to protect sensitive information and maintain trust
among attendees. Continuous monitoring and quick response strategies were necessary to address any
security threats, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the summit's digital environment.
5 Study Implications
5.1 Government Sector Research
The findings from this study across six government organizations in Saudi Arabia provide lessons which
have far-reaching implications for future investigations in the public sector. For example, one main point is
that technology initiatives need to be aligned with national strategic priorities, such as the Saudi Vision
2030. This will increase the probability that these projects are successful and ensure that they contribute
towards wider economic and social goals. Another area of enquiry could be around understanding how the
success of technological ventures in various parts of a country or different industries is affected by
strategic alignment, thereby providing deeper insights into what drives successful adoption of emerging
technologies.
Another research finding emphasises the significance of an adaptable, skilled workforce. As shown in this study,
proactive leadership, continuous upskilling, and effective talent management play a critical role in ensuring the
smooth integration of emerging technologies. Therefore, it is recommended that scholars investigate how
organizations can promote such skills among their employees through development programs which might also work
well within other contexts where workers need to be prepared for technological changes.
Moreover, these findings further highlight the importance of partnerships and collaborations as catalysts for
technology diffusion. It was established that public-private partnership models, ecosystem-building activities, and
knowledge-sharing platforms play vital roles in fostering innovation within the delivery of services. Hence, more
studies should be conducted to identify different types of partnership structures at various levels (national, regional or
local) while considering variables like duration, scope, cost-sharing ratios, etc., which may influence adoption
outcomes and leading to closer formulation guidelines aimed at encouraging sustainable and impactful public-private
partnerships within governmental setups.
5.2 Government Sector Policy
The study has significant policy implications for government organizations based on its findings, without
any additional information being considered necessary or relevant at this point. First, strong policies
should be set that are supported by effective governance systems, which are required when adopting
emerging technologies. Standards of ethics and security protocols must be followed during implementation
to ensure they meet legal requirements. Second, policymakers need to develop adaptable frameworks that
can keep pace with changing technological advancements and encourage the responsible use of technology
across different sectors within the public domain.
Furthermore, this study illustrates the need to improve data and analytics capabilities in government agencies.
Effective data management is essential for making informed decisions based on accurate facts, thus benefiting all
citizens equally and without discrimination. It was also established that more investments should be made towards
building strong foundations by leveraging advanced analytical tools required to modernize service delivery processes
underpinned by robust architectures designed around quality information sources. 
Another policy implication from this study centres around addressing digital divide issues. Policymakers should
devise strategies aimed at ensuring there is equal access to ICTs irrespective of their location or status, so as not to
leave anyone behind when everything becomes automated, which could create disparities in terms of technology
adoption rates between different parts of society, with some people being left out simply because they have not
developed the necessary skills through formal education or do not have access to appropriate resources.
5.3 Government Sector Practices
This study also has practical implications for practice within government organizations. First, effective
cost management is key in allocating and utilizing resources efficiently. Government entities ought to
adopt systematic resource management approaches that ensure optimal utilization of financial resources
while keeping projects within budgetary allocation to promote financial sustainability in technological
undertakings and responsible use of public funds.
Another significant practical result is efficient organizational change management. This includes strong training
programs and communication plans as part of wider change management strategies so that services are not
interrupted during technological adoption while ensuring smooth transitions occur. Governments need to develop
comprehensive systems for managing change that cater for employee concerns and support them through the process.
It is also critical that processes and operations should be optimized. Workflow optimization, risk management and
project management should be considered when implementing emerging technologies in government establishments.
It is important for governments to streamline workflows, identify potential threats or hazards, and then find ways of
mitigating them before finally applying good practices in project execution, which will enhance operational efficiency,
thereby leading to the successful completion of technology projects.
User-centred design represents practice implications. Involving stakeholders from the design stage until
implementation, making sure the system can be used by everyone regardless of their abilities or disabilities, and then
continuously improving on what has been achieved based on feedback given by those who have interacted with a
system are some of the requirements for technology adoption to succeed. Governments should adhere more strictly to
user-centred design principles in their projects so that users can feel satisfied with them. This also increases adoption
rates, while ensuring that solutions meet user requirements.
To conclude, broad-based recommendations derived from this study offer substantial guidance towards realizing
viable means through which emerging technologies can be adopted within different public organizations globally.
Complexities involved in integrating various types of information systems require alignment at the strategic level;
robust policy formulation needs to be accompanied by effective governance structures; workforce capacity
development should address skills gaps among staff members; process improvement initiatives must focus on
streamlining procedures rather than merely automating tasks; strong technology platforms, coupled with adequate
infrastructural support, must be provided across the organization’s ecosystem; enhancement of data analytics
capabilities will enable organizations to make informed decisions about resource allocation, thus enhancing service
delivery outcomes.
6 LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
The adoption of emerging technologies in government sectors is limited but has many possibilities for
further study, as shown by the six case studies on which the EGTAF is based. While this investigation
covers a wide range of possibilities across different organizations, it might not account for all the
challenges or enablers within other areas or contexts. Moreover, most of these investigations concentrate
on the initial phases of technological adoption, lacking the longitudinal data required for understanding
sustainable impacts and scalability over time. Essentially, these case studies are based on specific sociopolitical, economic and cultural conditions in Saudi Arabia, which makes it impossible to apply them
universally, especially where governance structures differ greatly from those found here or cultural
attitudes towards technology differ significantly. 
Moreover, each of the technologies studied, i.e., AI, blockchain and Metaverse, has distinct features,
coupled with challenges that can be quite dissimilar from any other emergent technology, such as
quantum computing or robotics.
Additionally, this study’s findings mainly reflect opinions given by project managers and senior leaders,
thus overlooking contributions made by various stakeholders, including end users. It should also be noted
that while ethical considerations were mentioned in passing, the study did not cover the long-term
consequences of ethical or privacy-related issues such as data protection rights, but rather focused on
algorithmic bias during health care provision or within the justice delivery sector.
A number of future research directions are suggested so that these shortcomings may be addressed,
thus enhancing our knowledge of the ways that emerging technologies affect governments’ service
provision: carrying out time-based inquiries aimed specifically at monitoring effects associated with
adoption more widely than before; bringing comparisons between regional governance systems into the
picture; being open minded in seeking a variety of views; going deeper into studying ethical issues and
privacy brought about by these technologies themselves, as well as proper usage grounded on sensitivity
such as the legal framework governing healthcare delivery systems.
Considering these limitations and expanding understanding of the impact of emerging technologies in
government organizations, further investigations should be carried out, such as following up what
happens at different points after technology adoption takes place. These developments are likely to change
from one part of the world to another, taking into account wider-ranging effects on communities, as well
as looking into flexibility within public organizations faced with such transformations. Relationships
should also be explored among various players involved in innovative ecosystems that foster collaboration
between government industry, academia, and civil society.
Addressing these limitations through the types of research mentioned above can provide a more
nuanced and comprehensive understanding of what makes technological integration successful in
government services, contributing to the development of more effective, ethical, and sustainable public
service innovations.
