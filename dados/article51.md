between individuals receiving care and their healthcare
professionals [3]. This strategy not only elevates the standard
of care provided but also encourages patients to become
more engaged and proactive in their own health management
journey. Additionally, the data-driven nature of e-health systems supports evidence-based practices, facilitates medical
research, and contributes to the continuous improvement of
healthcare delivery models.
A. EVOLUTION OF E-HEALTH
Healthcare documentation initially relied entirely on paper
records. Healthcare providers manually recorded patient
information, treatment histories, prescriptions, and test
results. These paper-based systems were cumbersome, prone
to errors, and difficult to manage, primarily as patient
volumes and the complexity of medical care increased. The
transition from paper-based records to EHRs began in the late
20th century. The goal was to improve the accuracy, accessibility, and efficiency of health information management.
Early EHR systems were primarily used for administrative
tasks like patient registration, scheduling, and billing. They
were often standalone systems with limited interoperability.
In the 1990s, health information systems (HIS) were developed to integrate various aspects of healthcare management,
such as patient management, laboratory information, and
pharmacy information systems. These systems aimed to
create a more cohesive and streamlined workflow within
healthcare institutions, improving data management and
reducing redundancies, focusing on digitizing health records
and administrative processes. The rapid advancement of
information and communication technologies (ICT) during
this period enabled the development of more sophisticated
and capable EHR systems. Increased computing power and
the proliferation of the internet significantly enhanced the
capabilities of these systems. The spending has consistently increased, reflecting the growing need for robust
cybersecurity measures in the healthcare industry due to
rising cyber threats. Projected values for 2024, 2025, and
2026 indicate continued growth at a compound annual growth
rate of 14.1%, reaching over 27 billion USD by 2026 [4].
Figure 1 illustrates the global spending on cybersecurity in
the healthcare sector from 2019 to 2026 [5].

structure for this paper.
II. EVOLVING THREATS IN HEALTHCARE DATA SECURITY
Healthcare data breaches have significantly increased over
the past 14 years, with a notable surge in recent years.
FIGURE 3. Organizational structure of the paper.
From October 2009 to December 2023, 5,887 breaches
involving 500 or more records were reported to the Office
for Civil Rights (OCR), exposing over 519 million records.
In 2023 alone, 725 breaches were reported, impacting
over 133 million records, the highest on record. Hacking
and ransomware attacks have become the primary causes,
with hacking incidents rising by 239% and ransomware
by 278% between 2018 and 2023. Major breaches include
the 2015 Anthem Inc. breach affecting 78.8 million individuals and the 2024 Change Healthcare ransomware attack,
potentially affecting up to one-third of Americans. Due to
chronic underfunding, the OCR continues to need help with
a backlog of investigations. The shift from theft or loss of
records to hacking incidents highlights the evolving nature of
cyber threats in healthcare [14].
In 2023, the OCR reported a staggering 239% increase
in hacking-related breaches and a 278% rise in ransomware
attacks between January 1, 2018, and September 30, 2023.
Hacking accounted for 49% of breaches in 2019, escalating to
79.7% in 2023. Not only are the numbers of breaches increasing, but their severity is also intensifying. In 2021, breaches
compromised 45.9 million records, worsening to 51.9 million
in 2022 and reaching an unprecedented high of 133 million
in 2023. This alarming total includes 26 breaches exceeding
1 million records and four breaches surpassing 8 million, with
the most significant breach affecting 11,270,000 individuals
marking it as the second-largest healthcare data breach in
history [15].
Security and privacy are critical pillars within the e-health
systems’ framework, primarily due to their pivotal role in
managing highly sensitive personal health data [16]. The
importance of these aspects is immense, given that any security compromise can result in severe privacy breaches, limited
data access, compromised data integrity, and the potential for
significant harm to individuals [17]. Ensuring the security
and privacy of e-health systems is crucial for maintaining
patient trust, which is fundamental for successfully adopting
and utilizing these technologies. Without robust security
measures and privacy protections, some patients may be
reluctant to share their health information, hindering the
potential benefits of e-health initiatives [18]. Moreover,
compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, such
as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA) in the United States, necessitates stringent security
and privacy controls to protect patient information and avoid
legal penalties [19]. Comprehensive measures, including
technical safeguards, secure authentication, access controls,
regular audits, user education, and privacy by design in
e-health system development, are crucial to effectively
addressing security and privacy concerns [20]. Prioritizing
security and privacy in healthcare and e-health development
ensures regulatory compliance and cultivates a healthcare
environment where patients trust that their health data is
handled responsibly and respectfully.
The integration of advanced technologies such as AI and
ML further enhances the capabilities of e-health systems,
particularly in the areas of security and privacy [21].
AI/ML algorithms can process vast amounts of healthcare
data to identify patterns, detect anomalies, and predict
potential security threats, thereby bolstering the defenses
against cyberattacks and safeguarding sensitive patient information [22]. Additionally, AI/ML-driven techniques can
optimize access controls, encryption methods, and authentication mechanisms to ensure robust security measures
while maintaining user privacy [23]. By leveraging AI/ML
technologies, e-health systems can achieve greater resilience
against cybersecurity risks and instill confidence in patients
regarding protecting their health data [24].
Figure 4 shows the healthcare industry cyber-attacks by the
number of patients affected for the year 2022-2023 [25].

III. VULNERABILITIES IN E-HEALTH SYSTEM
INFRASTRUCTURE
The rapid advancement and adoption of e-health systems
have revolutionized healthcare delivery by integrating many
digital technologies [26]. However, this evolution also brings
numerous vulnerabilities within the e-health infrastructure.
Compliance challenges also arise in the cloud environment,
as healthcare providers must navigate complex regulations
such as HIPAA to ensure that patient data is handled securely
and per legal requirements [27]. This section delves into the
specific security challenges posed by the core components of
e-health systems, including cloud computing platforms, the
Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), mobile health (mHealth)
applications, and electronic health records (EHRs) [28].
A. CLOUD COMPUTING PLATFORMS
Cloud computing platforms provide scalable, flexible
resources essential for managing healthcare data and
performing complex analytics [29]. Despite their benefits,
they introduce several vulnerabilities, as mentioned below:
Data Breaches: Cloud services can suffer from data
breaches, where sensitive patient information is exposed [30].
These breaches are often a result of poor security practices, such as weak passwords or lack of multi-factor
authentication.
Unauthorized Access: Misconfigured cloud services and
weak authentication protocols can lead to unauthorized
access to stored data [31]. Cybercriminals exploit these
weaknesses using techniques such as:
• Phishing: Phishing attacks are characterized by sending
bogus emails or messages that appear authentic [32].
These emails aim to deceive users into disclosing their
login credentials on counterfeit websites or through
other methods.
• Keylogging: Keyloggers are malicious software or hardware designed to record keystrokes entered by users,
thereby capturing sensitive information like usernames
and passwords [33].
• Person-in-the-Middle (PITM) Attacks: In PITM attacks,
hackers intercept communication between two parties, capturing login credentials exchanged during the
authentication process [34].
• Brute Force Attacks: In brute force attacks, attackers
methodically attempt numerous combinations of usernames and passwords to access a system or account [35].
• Credential Stuffing: Attackers leverage credentials
obtained from prior breaches to illicitly access additional
accounts, exploiting instances where users have reused
identical usernames and passwords [36].
Compliance Challenges: Navigating regulatory compliance in cloud environments is complex. Healthcare providers
should verify that their cloud service providers comply
with HIPAA laws, which mandate stringent data protection
standards [37]. Inadequate compliance with these standards
can cause significant legal repercussions and diminished
trust [38].
B. ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS)
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have become an integral
part of the modern healthcare ecosystem, with their adoption
reaching near-universal levels in many advanced nations[39],
[40]. By 2024, the United States has achieved over 95%
EHR implementation in non-federal acute care hospitals,
exemplifying this trend. This widespread adoption has
yielded significant benefits, including better coordination of
care, fewer medical errors, and improved clinical decisionmaking support. However, the rapid shift towards digital
health information has concurrently intensified security
concerns associated with these systems. A primary challenge
in EHR security is the escalating complexity of cyber
threats [41]. Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems
face other significant security challenges due to software
vulnerabilities, phishing attacks, and insufficient access
controls [42]. Many EHR systems operate on outdated
software without current security patches, making them
susceptible to exploitation [43]. Healthcare staff are often
targeted by phishing attacks that trick them into revealing
login credentials or installing malicious software, leading
to data breaches [44]. Poorly implemented access controls
can also allow unauthorized individuals to access sensitive
patient information [45]. To maintain the security of EHR
data, it is essential to regularly update software, enforce
strict access policies, and conduct frequent audits. Healthcare
institutions have experienced a notable increase in cyberattacks, with cybercriminals targeting the vital nature of
medical data for substantial financial gain. These breaches
jeopardize patient confidentiality and can interrupt essential
care services, potentially endangering lives. Furthermore,
the advent of AI-enhanced hacking tools has simplified
the process for malicious entities to detect and exploit
EHR system vulnerabilities, necessitating the development
of more sophisticated cybersecurity strategies. The quest
for seamless data sharing across various healthcare systems
and organizations introduces additional security risks for
EHRs through interoperability challenges. As the network of
data exchange points expands, so does the potential attack
surface, requiring the implementation of strong encryption
and secure data transmission protocols. Additionally, the
growing emphasis on patient empowerment through access
to their health records via online portals and mobile apps
presents new security hurdles, as these access points must
be safeguarded against unauthorized entry while maintaining
user-friendliness.
C. INTERNET OF MEDICAL THINGS (IOMT)
The IoMT connects various medical devices and applications,
enhancing patient care through real-time data collection and
monitoring. However, it also introduces several security risks:
Device Vulnerabilities: Many IoMT devices are vulnerable
to cyber attacks due to insufficient security protocols. For
example, a compromised pacemaker or insulin pump can lead
to dire consequences, potentially endangering patients’ lives.
Data Interception: The wireless communication between
IoMT devices and healthcare systems can be intercepted if
not properly encrypted. Unauthorized interception of this data
can lead to privacy breaches and manipulation of critical
health information
Remote Attacks: IoMT devices, often lacking robust
security features, can be susceptible to remote attacks. These
attacks can disrupt the functionality of medical devices,
potentially causing harm to patients who rely on them for
critical health monitoring and treatment [46].
IV. THE ROLE OF HUMAN FACTORS IN E-HEALTH
SECURITY AND THEIR IMPACT ON AI-DRIVEN
CYBERSECURITY
Human factors in e-health security refer to the various
human elements that influence the effectiveness of security
measures, including user behavior, skills, decision-making,
and the overall interaction between humans and technology.
These factors play a critical role in determining the success
or failure of cybersecurity efforts. In e-health systems, human
factors encompass the actions and awareness of healthcare professionals, patients, and cybersecurity operators in
maintaining security protocols, managing sensitive data, and
responding to potential threats. The significance of human
factors lies in their direct impact on the resilience of security
systems. While advanced technologies like AI and automated
tools help safeguard digital health systems, human behavior
and decision-making often introduce vulnerabilities. Human
vulnerabilities arise from user mistakes, exposing networks,
hardware, and sensitive information to malicious threats.
They constitute the most significant danger, mainly because
of the increasing number of remote and mobile workers.
Examples of human weaknesses in security involve opening
email attachments laced with malware or failing to apply
software updates on mobile devices. Another scenario is
when sophisticated defenses are in place; a user’s mistake,
such as clicking on a phishing link or failing to update
a password, can expose sensitive information. Hence, user
skills, awareness, and the ability to make informed security
decisions are crucial in defending against cyberattacks.
In crisis management, human factors are particularly critical. Cybersecurity professionals handle technical challenges
and face immense psychological stress from continuous cyber
threats. Their decision-making under pressure, ability to
quickly adapt to new security threats, and understanding of
AI-driven tools for incident management all play a vital role
in maintaining the integrity of e-health systems. Ensuring
that professionals are equipped with technical expertise and
psychological resilience is critical to addressing the growing
number of cyberattacks in healthcare environments.
Motivation, ability, and triggers influence behavior, making it crucial to foster strong cybersecurity habits among
healthcare workers. Organizations can enhance cybersecurity
by providing adequate training, tools, and prompts to guide
behavior, improving resilience against cyber threats. This
holistic approach to e-health security addresses the technical
and human aspects necessary to secure modern healthcare
systems. Some other cybersecurity challenges of the health
sector are remote work security assurance, endpoint device
management, human errors, the lack of security awareness,
inadequate senior-level security risk assessment, inadequate
business continuity plans, the lack of coordinated incident
response, constraints on budget and resources, and vulnerability of medical systems. To address the challenges
of human factors in e-health security, enhancing education and employee awareness is critical. A foundational
step involves introducing essential cybersecurity awareness
early in the educational system, with expert-led lectures,
workshops, and academic collaborations to foster industryrelevant skills. Exposing students to real-world practices
through internships can provide valuable, hands-on experience with security challenges. For healthcare employees,
regular training sessions emphasizing best practices, such as
recognizing phishing attacks and following company protocols, are essential. Organizations should introduce mandatory
e-learning courses focused on security awareness, and
advanced security policies should be implemented to ensure
compliance and safeguard systems from evolving threats.
These united efforts target creating a workforce attuned
to security and capable of mitigating risks in the e-health
environment through knowledge and skill. As healthcare
systems increasingly adopt artificial intelligence and machine
learning for sophisticated analytics and personalized medical
treatments, new security paradigms become essential. These
emerging frameworks must protect the sensitive underlying
data. Moreover, complex algorithms and models process and
interpret this vital health information.
V. AI-DRIVEN TECHNIQUES FOR THREAT DETECTION
AND PREVENTION: SUPERVISED VS. UNSUPERVISED
LEARNING
A. SUPERVISED LEARNING MODELS
In AI-driven threat detection and prevention, various models and techniques utilize machine learning and artificial
intelligence to bolster security measures across various applications. Supervised learning models leverage labeled datasets
to identify and categorize threats accurately. Techniques such
as Machine Learning Classification, Signature-Based Detection, Behavioral Analysis, Deep Learning, Support Vector
Machines (SVM), Random Forests, Logistic Regression, and
Neural Networks are designed to detect known and evolving
threats by learning from historical data and adapting to new
patterns. These models excel in providing accurate threat
detection and response by utilizing pre-labeled examples to
train and refine their algorithms [47]. Table 2 below shows
a Comparison of Supervised Learning Techniques in Threat
Detection and Prevention.
Table 2 below shows a Comparison of Supervised Learning
Techniques in Threat Detection and Prevention.
B. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING MODELS
On the other hand, unsupervised learning techniques operate
without predefined labels, focusing on discovering hidden
patterns and anomalies within datasets. Methods such as
Anomaly Detection, Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction,
Association Rule Learning, and User Behavior Analytics
using k-nearest Neighbors (k-NN) are particularly valuable
for identifying novel or unknown threats. By analyzing
deviations from typical behavior, these techniques can
uncover new and previously unknown security issues that
might not be detectable using traditional methods. Together,
these AI-driven approaches provide a robust framework
for safeguarding systems against cyber threats, including
phishing, malware, network intrusions, and insider attacks.
Table 3 below shows a Comparison of Unsupervised
Learning Techniques in Threat Detection and Prevention.
VI. PRIVACY-PRESERVING AI TECHNIQUES IN E-HEALTH:
Privacy-preserving AI techniques are essential for protecting
sensitive health data in e-health systems, ensuring confidentiality and security. Fundamental approaches, including
federated learning (FL), differential privacy (DP), Data
Anonymization (DA), Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and
secure multiparty computation (SMPC), are recognized
as practical solutions for maintaining data privacy while
allowing for the analysis and sharing of medical information.
These techniques are vital in healthcare, where regulations
like GDPR and HIPAA prioritize patient data protection.
This evaluation reviews the strengths and limitations of these
methods and explores their potential applications in e-health
systems [58].
A. FEDERATED LEARNING
Federated Learning (FL) permits multiple institutions,
including hospitals and clinics, to train a machine learning
model without transferring raw data. Instead, they share
model updates, like gradients and weights, aggregated to
improve the global model [59].
The FL process begins with initialization. A central server
initializes the global model and distributes it to local clients,
TABLE 2. Comparison of supervised learning techniques in threat detection and prevention.
such as hospitals. Each client then engages in local training,
where the model is trained on its local dataset, and model
updates are computed. These local updates are subsequently
sent back to the central server for aggregation, typically
using techniques like Federated Averaging. The central
server incorporates the aggregated information into the global
model. This iterative process continues for several rounds
until the model converges.
FL offers several benefits. Keeping raw data localized
reduces the risk of data breaches. The approach is well-suited
for large datasets distributed across multiple locations and
helps comply with data protection regulations like GDPR
and HIPAA. However, there are challenges associated
with FL. The frequent transmission of model updates
can be bandwidth-intensive. Variability in data distribution
and quality across clients can affect model performance.
TABLE 3. Comparison of unsupervised learning techniques in threat detection and prevention.
Additionally, potential vulnerabilities in model updates could
leak information if not properly secured.
B. DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY:
Differential Privacy (DP) provides a mathematical framework
to quantify and control the privacy risk of individuals when
analyzing aggregate data [60]. It ensures that the output
of a computation does not significantly change when any
individual’s data is added or removed. DP follows the below
process:
Injecting random noise into the data or computation results,
typically calibrated to the desired privacy level epsilon (ϵ).
Carefully manages the privacy budget by ensuring that data
analysis provides valuable insights while still protecting the
privacy of individuals in the dataset. Algorithms such as the
Laplace Mechanism (for numerical data) or the Exponential
Mechanism (for categorical data) are used to add noise.
DP presents the following benefits:
Quantifiable Privacy: Provides a clear metric (ϵ) to
balance privacy and data utility.
Strong Guarantees: Ensures that outputs do not reveal
significant information about any individual.
Flexibility: Applicable to various data analysis tasks,
including statistical analysis, machine learning, and data
publishing. There are some challenges associated with DP,
as seen below: High privacy levels can reduce the accuracy
and utility of the data. Requires careful design to ensure
appropriate noise addition. Effective utilization of the privacy
budget is critical to maintaining utility over multiple queries.
C. SECURE MULTIPARTY COMPUTATION (SMPC)
Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC) allows multiple
parties to compute a function collaboratively while ensuring
the privacy of their inputs. Each party only knows their input
and the final output, with intermediate computations kept
confidential [61].
The SMPC process begins with input sharing, where each
party divides its input into multiple shares and distributes
them to other parties. During joint computation, parties
collaboratively perform calculations on the shared inputs
without revealing their actual values. Techniques like secret
sharing and homomorphic encryption are often used. Finally,
the parties combine their shares of the result to reconstruct
the final output in result reconstruction.
SMPC offers several benefits. It ensures privacy preservation by keeping individual data confidential throughout
the computation. It guarantees against adversaries, as no
single party can infer the complete input. SMPC applies to
collaborative tasks like joint disease modeling, multi-center
clinical studies, and shared data analysis.
However, there are challenges associated with SMPC.
It can be resource-intensive, requiring significant
computational power and time. Implementing SMPC
protocols can be technically complex and requires careful
coordination. Managing the computation and communication
overhead can be challenging with many participants.
D. HOMOMORPHIC ENCRYPTION (HE)
Homomorphic Encryption enables calculations to be done on
encrypted data without revealing its underlying content. This
technique is beneficial in e-health systems, where sensitive
patient data must often be processed on cloud-based AI
systems. Homomorphic encryption safeguards data privacy
by allowing computations to be performed directly on
encrypted data. Even if an unauthorized party intercepts the
encrypted data, it cannot extract any meaningful information
without the decryption key. This approach provides a strong
layer of privacy protection, particularly in environments
where data is transmitted to third-party servers for processing.
Data Anonymization techniques are commonly used to
protect privacy in e-health systems by removing or obscuring
personally identifiable information (PII) from patient datasets
before they are used for AI training. This technique masks
or removes sensitive personal details from datasets, making
identifying the individuals associated with the information
harder. Although data anonymization is not foolproof, especially when combined with other datasets, it remains a widely
used method for mitigating privacy risks in AI systems.
When paired with advanced methods like differential privacy
or homomorphic encryption, anonymization can further
enhance privacy protections in e-health applications.
E. DATA ANONYMIZATION (DA)
Data Anonymization involves removing or obscuring personally identifiable information (PII) from patient datasets
before they are used in AI training, reducing the risk of
identifying individuals. This process ensures that sensitive
details, such as names, addresses, or medical IDs, are
removed or altered. While anonymization is not foolproof,
especially when data is combined with other datasets,
it is widely used to mitigate privacy risks. Combined
with techniques like Differential Privacy or Homomorphic
Encryption, anonymization enhances privacy in e-health
applications.
VII. SECURE MODEL DEPLOYMENT AND MANAGEMENT
Deploying and managing AI and machine learning models
in e-health systems is crucial for safeguarding the security
and privacy of sensitive health data [62]. Effective strategies
in these areas can help mitigate potential risks and enhance
the overall robustness of e-health systems. Here’s an in-depth
discussion on secure model deployment and management:
A. SECURE MODEL DEPLOYMENT
1) Environment Isolation:
• Containerization and Virtualization: Use containerization (e.g., Docker) and virtualization
(e.g., Kubernetes) to isolate models from other
system components. This strategy minimizes the
risk of security breaches spreading across different
system parts.
• Sandboxing: Deploy models in sandboxed environments to test their behavior in a controlled
