Title: Enabling Industrial Internet of Things by Leveraging Distributed Edge-to-Cloud Computing: Challenges and Opportunities

ABSTRACT The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) promises automation, efficiency, and data-driven
decision-making by real-time data collection and analysis. However, traditional IIoT architectures are
cloud-centric and, therefore, struggle to handle large volumes of data, edge bandwidth constraints, and
data confidentiality. Distributed edge-to-cloud computing emerges as a potential solution, also paving the
ground for edge-to-cloud data analytics and distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI) to obtain insights for
decision-making and predictive maintenance. Despite the potential, however, there is a lack of comprehensive
studies identifying key requirements for distributed edge-to-cloud IIoT and analyzing to what extent
emerging IoT platforms meet those requirements. The scope of this article is to survey existing literature to
identify key requirements in IIoT from the perspective of distributed edge-to-cloud computing. We provide
a comparative analysis of three prominent IoT platforms, namely ThingsBoard, Eclipse Ditto, and Microsoft
Azure IoT, and assess how these platforms meet the key IIoT requirements. Finally, we identify open
challenges and potential research opportunities based on the insights gained from the analysis of the three
IoT platforms, thereby setting the stage for future work.

I. INTRODUCTION
The advent of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has
paved the way for unprecedented levels of automation,
efficiency, and data-driven decision-making in industrial
settings. It has gained compelling attention in recent years
due to its potential for smarter and more efficient industrial
productions. It has significantly transformed industrial landscapes by connecting a vast network of industrial devices,
enabling real-time data collection, analysis, and decisionmaking. This data-driven approach has led to improved
operational efficiency, reduced downtime, and enhanced
productivity [1]. However, traditional IIoT architectures, with
their reliance on cloud computing, face inherent limitations
in handling the massive volume and velocity of IIoT data,
bandwidth constraints, and data confidentiality. To address
these challenges, distributed edge-to-cloud computing has
emerged as a promising paradigm, which refers to the
use of edge computing and cloud computing together to
enable IIoT [2]. Cloud computing provides a scalable and
cost-effective way to store and process large amounts of data,
while edge computing brings computation and data storage
closer to the location where it is needed [3]. By bringing
computational resources closer to the data sources, distributed edge-to-cloud computing leads to faster insights
and responses, reduces network bandwidth requirements and
enhances data confidentiality [4]. It enables organizations to
avail the benefits of edge computing and cloud infrastructure,
facilitating real-time decision-making and boosting system
performance.
Edge-to-cloud data analytics is crucial in harnessing the
full potential of the IIoT. It facilitates real-time processing
and intelligent decision-making near the data source, which
is crucial for time-sensitive IIoT applications. By integrating
edge and cloud computing, organizations can process IIoT
data more efficiently, leading to faster insights and actions.
For instance, edge computing can pre-process data locally,
reducing response time and bandwidth requirements, while
cloud computing offers scalable data storage and advanced
analytics capabilities [5]. This symbiotic relationship ensures
that the vast amounts of data generated by IoT devices,
which are typically dynamic, heterogeneous, and voluminous
in nature, are processed effectively, which, in turn, allows
for more precise control and enhanced operational visibility,
furthering the evolution of the IIoT. In addition, leveraging
Artificial Intelligence (AI) like machine learning and deep
learning with edge-to-cloud architectures enables predictive
maintenance, quality control, and supply chain optimization.
By analyzing data patterns and trends, AI can anticipate
equipment failures or production bottlenecks, leading to
proactive measures that save time and resources. This intelligent analysis also paves the way for personalized production
processes and dynamic supply chain adjustments, aligning
with the evolving demands of the market. Hence, edgeto-cloud data analytics and distributed AI not only enable
advanced analytics but also empower efficient extraction of
valuable insights, essential for intelligent decision-making
in various sectors like smart manufacturing and precision
agriculture.
In existing literature, several studies have highlighted the
importance of edge-to-cloud data analytics and distributed AI
in transforming the IIoT landscape and how they can unlock
new opportunities for automation, efficiency, and innovation
in industrial settings. Abel et al. [6] focuses on the integration
of IoT sensing devices with edge and cloud infrastructures
to handle massive data streams, addressing challenges
like data outliers, redundancies, and cloud resource load
balancing. It reviews 72 algorithms across various categories,
providing insights into the effective management of IoT
data streams. The significance of that study includes its
comprehensive review of existing algorithms and the analysis
of their effectiveness in various scenarios. It also identifies
weaknesses in these algorithms, such as their performance
under different conditions and the physical and virtual cloud
storage servers for resource load balancing. That study,
however, does not delve deeply into specific IoT platforms
for implementing these analytic algorithms in diverse realworld scenarios, focusing more on the general overview
and challenges of the IoT-enabled edge cloud infrastructure.
Hemmati et al. [7] presents a systematic literature review
covering 85 articles published between 2018 and 2023 related
to edge AI. That study examines measurement environments
and factors applied to edge AI for big data. It also discusses
taxonomies specific to edge AI within the big data domain,
case studies, and the challenges and open issues inherent in
edge AI for big data. That study, however, does not investigate
the applicability of edge AI on existing IoT platforms,
focusing more on providing insights into edge AI techniques
and their potential in handling large volumes of data.
Rosendo et al. [8] delves into the cutting-edge frameworks
and architectures combining big data analytics, machine
learning, and deep learning to empower intelligence on the
edge-to-cloud continuum. It discusses the challenges of edge
computing and proposes solutions for real-time data analysis.
The significance of that study lies in its practical approach to
emphasizing the importance of distributed intelligence on the
edge-to-cloud continuum and presenting novel frameworks
and architectures for distributed processing and machine
learning to enhance the efficiency of IoT data analysis.
That study, however, does not explore the applicability of
distributed intelligence on existing IoT platforms, focusing
more on addressing the theoretical and architectural aspects
of distributed intelligence on the edge-to-cloud continuum.
Over the last few years, several IoT platforms have
emerged to tackle challenges associated with IIoT and
facilitate distributed edge-to-cloud computing for IIoT applications. In existing literature, few studies have explored
some of these IoT platforms independently. For example, Ottolini et al. [9] provides an insight into the
trade-off between interoperability and performance of three
open-source IoT platforms. That study shows that interoperability features offered by each platform are not firmly related
to its performance and scalability. However, to the best of our
knowledge, no study examines how the emerging IoT platforms address the key IIoT requirements from the perspective
of distributed edge-to-cloud computing. So there is a need
for a comprehensive survey that analyzes key requirements
in IIoT and distributed edge-to-cloud computing, and how
leading IoT platforms address these requirements.
Hence, this survey paper is motivated by the need to
systematically explore and compare the capabilities of
IoT platforms in addressing key requirements in IIoT and
distributed edge-to-cloud computing. It first identifies the
key IIoT requirements from the perspective of distributed
edge-to-cloud computing based on existing literature. After
identifying the key IIoT requirements, this survey focuses
on three pivotal IoT platforms, namely ThingsBoard [10],
Eclipse Ditto [11], and Microsoft Azure IoT [12], to investigate how these platforms address the key IIoT requirements
and where each platform excels or falters. These three
platforms were chosen since they offer distinct features and
strengths, addressing different requirements and use cases
within the IIoT domain. For instance, ThingsBoard provides
a comprehensive platform for managing IoT devices, data
collection, and application development, while Eclipse Ditto
focuses on data synchronization and consistency across edge
devices and cloud servers, and Microsoft Azure IoT offers
a robust cloud-based platform for device management, data
analysis, and application deployment. Finally, this paper
explores potential research opportunities and challenges for
distributed edge-to-cloud computing in IIoT and discusses
some promising use cases.
To summarize, the contributions are as follows.
1) The key IIoT requirements from the perspective of distributed edge-to-cloud computing are identified based
on existing literature (Section II).
2) The capabilities of three leading IoT platforms, namely
ThingsBoard, Eclipse Ditto, and Microsoft Azure IoT,
are compared by examining how they address the
key IIoT requirements, and the author’s critique and
observations regarding the strengths and limitations of
these platforms are presented (Section III).
3) Open challenges and potential research opportunities
for distributed edge-to-cloud computing in IIoT are
identifies based on the insights gained from the analysis
of the three IoT platforms (Section IV).
II. INDUSTRIAL INTERNET OF THINGS REQUIREMENTS
IIoT, an inclusive term applied in various industrial domains,
denotes an industrial framework comprising interconnected
devices and diverse software tools to facilitate intelligent
industrial operations, leading to transformative business
outcomes [13]. At its core, IIoT connects industrial assets,
such as machinery and equipment, to smart sensors and
actuators, enabling data collection and exchange. This
data-driven approach allows for real-time monitoring and
analysis, predictive maintenance, and improved decisionmaking [14]. IIoT leverages technologies like machine
learning, artificial intelligence, big data analytics, edge
computing, and cloud computing to process and interpret the
vast amounts of data generated by industrial devices [15].
This results in optimized operations, reduced downtime, and
enhanced safety and sustainability in industrial environments.
In summary, IIoT operates on the integration of various
components, which allows for data collection, exchange,
and analysis, potentially improving efficiency, productivity,
performance, and reliability in industrial operations.
A generic IIoT stack (Figure 1), which represents the
layers of technology that make up an IIoT system, typically
involves layers including devices/sensors, connectivity, data
processing, and applications [16].
1) Device Layer: Comprises the physical devices and
sensors that collect data from the industrial environment.
2) Connectivity Layer: Involves the communication technologies that enable data transfer between devices and
the cloud or data centers.
3) Data Processing Layer: Involves the technologies used
for data storage, processing, and analysis, often utilizing
cloud computing and edge computing solutions.
4) Application Layer: Includes the applications and services that utilize the processed data to provide insights
and support decision-making.
Distributed edge-to-cloud computing can play a crucial
role in meeting the demand of emerging IIoT applications.
It allows data from smart sensors to be processed on the edge
layer, reducing latency and network congestion, enabling the
distributed control of industrial systems by providing local
computation and data storage, and enhancing efficiency and
productivity [17], [18]. The key IIoT requirements from the
perspective of edge-to-cloud computing are outlined below
based on existing literature [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24].
1) Edge-to-Cloud Data Analytics: Edge-to-cloud data
analytics in the context of the IIoT is pivotal for
FIGURE 1. A generic IIoT stack.
leveraging the vast amounts of data generated by
industrial devices and sensors. It refers to the process
where data collected by IIoT devices are processed and
analyzed not just in the centralized cloud data centers,
but also at the edge of the network, close to where data is
generated. This distributed approach to analytics allows
for real-time or near-real-time data processing, which
is critical for time-sensitive applications in industries.
It can lead to faster insights and responses while also
reducing the bandwidth needed to send data to the
cloud for analysis [25], [26]. Leveraging AI is also
crucial for realizing the capabilities of IIoT by extracting
insights from data at an accelerated pace. AI in the IIoT,
particularly when distributed from the edge to the cloud,
involves deploying machine learning models and AI
algorithms that can operate efficiently on edge devices
while also taking advantage of the cloud’s superior
computing power [27], [28]. This hybrid approach
supports advanced applications like intelligent cognitive
sensing, big data analytics, and security enhancements.
AI at the edge can provide immediate insights and
actions based on the data from sensors and devices,
while the cloud component of AI can handle more
complex processing tasks [29], [30]. Edge-to-cloud data
analytics and AI embody a transformative approach
that drives the IIoT towards greater automation and
intelligent decision-making.
2) Performance: Performance in the context of the IIoT is
critical to ensuring the efficiency, reliability, and responsiveness of industrial operations. Effective performance
management involves several key aspects, including
latency reduction and efficient resource utilization [31],
[32]. Reducing latency is crucial for IIoT applications
that require real-time or near-real-time data processing,
while efficient resource utilization is paramount for
maintaining high performance in IIoT systems. These
strategies collectively drive the effective functioning of
IIoT systems, enabling them to meet the demanding
requirements of modern industrial environments.
3) Scalability: Scalability in the realm of IIoT typically
refers to the system’s ability to handle growing amounts
of work or its potential to accommodate growth. There
are generally two types of scalability considered in
distributed systems, which can also apply to IIoT. They
are horizontal scalability (scaling out/in) and vertical
scalability (scaling up/down). Horizontal scalability
involves adding more nodes to (or removing nodes from)
a system, such as adding new sensors or devices to an
IIoT network to handle increased load or data processing
demands, while vertical scalability refers to adding more
power to (or removing power from) an existing system,
such as increasing the computational power of an edge
device or server within the IIoT framework to improve
performance [33]. In the context of distributed edgeto-cloud computing, scalability is crucial as it allows
for the dynamic allocation and reallocation of resources
across the network and cloud environments to meet the
fluctuating demands of industrial operations. Effective
scalability strategies ensure that the IIoT ecosystem can
maintain performance levels, remain resilient in the face
of varying workloads, and continue to integrate new
technologies and devices as they become available [34].
4) Interoperability: Interoperability in the realm of the
IIoT refers to the capability of diverse systems, devices,
and applications to seamlessly communicate, exchange,
and utilize information across different hardware and
software platforms. It is a crucial aspect for ensuring
that the various components within an IIoT ecosystem,
such as sensors, machines, and analytics platforms,
can effectively work together to optimize industrial
processes. In IIoT settings, interoperability is particularly challenging due to the variety of devices and
protocols involved. Achieving this requires not only
technical compatibility but also the ability to manage
and utilize the vast amounts of data generated by
these devices in a coherent manner [35]. This ensures
efficient data transfer and resource sharing across the
network, which is essential for the smooth functioning
of IIoT applications [33], [36]. In distributed edge-tocloud computing, interoperability is key to ensuring that
computation-intensive tasks can be offloaded efficiently
from IIoT devices to edge or cloud servers. This reduces
energy consumption and ensures timely completion of
tasks, enhancing overall IIoT system performance [37].
As IIoT continues to evolve with Industry 4.0 and 5.0,
interoperability remains a fundamental requirement to
leverage the full potential of smart industrial systems,
enabling enhanced communication, data exchange, and
resource sharing between edge devices and cloud
servers [38].
5) Fault-tolerance and Resiliency: Since devices are
densely deployed and interconnected in IIoT, faulttolerance and resiliency play a crucial role in withstanding and recovering from disruptions or failures
and ensuring the continuous operation and reliable
data collection of critical systems. Fault-tolerance is
the system’s ability to continue functioning correctly
in the event of certain kinds of failures within its
components. In the context of IIoT, this could mean
that the system maintains operational continuity even
when some nodes fail or when there are reliability issues
with edge devices. It is essential for ensuring that the
industrial processes dependent on these systems do not
experience unexpected downtimes or data losses [39].
Resiliency, while closely related, typically refers to the
system’s capacity to recover quickly from difficulties,
such as faults or disruptions. Distributed edge-to-cloud
computing offers a promising approach to enhance
fault tolerance and resiliency in IIoT by distributing
processing and data storage across multiple layers, from
edge devices to the cloud [23], [24].
6) Security: Security in the context of the IIoT refers
to the measures and strategies implemented to protect
interconnected industrial systems and devices from
various cyber threats and ensuring the integrity and
confidentiality of the massive amounts of data they
handle. These threats can include unauthorized access,
data breaches, malware attacks, and other forms of
cyberattacks such as phishing and Denial-of-Service
(DoS) attack that could disrupt industrial operations,
compromise data integrity, or lead to theft of sensitive
information. In this study, authentication, authorization,
access control policies, and encryption, which are
fundamental concepts in security, are focused as they
play a distinct role in ensuring the integrity and safety
of systems and data. Authentication in IIoT is the
process of verifying the identity of devices or users
attempting to access the network. It ensures that devices
and users are who they claim to be. This can involve
various methods such as passwords, digital certificates,
or biometric data. Authentication serves as the first
line of defense, preventing unauthorized entities from
entering the IIoT ecosystem [40]. Once authentication
is confirmed, authorization determines the levels of
access or the operations that authenticated devices or
users are permitted to perform within the IIoT system.
It involves setting permissions and rights for accessing
specific resources or data. Authorization ensures that
devices and users can only perform actions allowed
by their roles, contributing to the principle of least
privilege [41]. Access control policies in IIoT refers to
the mechanisms and rules that define how resources are
accessed within the network. These policies determine
how authentication and authorization are enforced,
specifying who can access what resources and under
what conditions. Access control policies can be based on
attributes, roles, or other models suited to the needs of
the IIoT infrastructure. They are crucial for maintaining
operational integrity and preventing unauthorized data
manipulation or access [42]. Encryption is a critical
security measure in IIoT that protects the confidentiality
and integrity of data as it moves across the network
or when it is stored. By converting data into a coded
format that can only be read by those with the decryption
key, encryption ensures that sensitive information is
shielded from eavesdroppers and cyber attackers. It is
vital for maintaining data confidentiality and securing
communication between IIoT devices and the cloud
or between devices themselves [43]. These security
measures are integral to the successful deployment of
IIoT systems, providing a robust framework to protect
against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other
cyber threats while maintaining the confidentiality of
sensitive industrial data [44].
In addition to the above requirements, we identified one
more key requirement, which is as follows.
7) Ease of Deployment: Ease of deployment in the
context of IIoT and distributed edge-to-cloud computing
is a critical factor that influences the adoption and
success of these technologies. It refers to the simplicity,
straightforwardness, and efficiency with which IIoT
devices and edge-to-cloud computing solutions can
be deployed across industrial settings. This involves
minimizing the complexity, time, and resources required
to implement and manage IIoT devices (also devices
connected to legacy and third-party systems) and the
computing infrastructure needed to support them, from
edge devices close to the source of data to cloud
platforms that process and analyze data at scale. Ease of
deployment is crucial for ensuring that IIoT systems can
be quickly and effectively integrated into industrial operations, enhancing their flexibility, scalability, and ability
to respond to changing requirements or conditions and
reap the benefits of digital transformation, including
improved operational efficiency, reduced downtime, and
enhanced data-driven decision-making capabilities.
III. IoT PLATFORMS
An IoT platform is a multifaceted software suite or service
that enables developers, businesses, and others to connect
and manage IoT devices, gather data from them, and
build applications. IoT platforms essentially bridge the gap
between the device sensors and data networks, offering
an integrated environment for the devices to communicate
and operate effectively. However, traditional IoT platforms,
designed primarily for simple data collection and processing,
often face challenges in the context of IIoT. In recent years,
some modern IoT platforms have evolved to address the
challenges of traditional IoT platforms and facilitate the
emerging requirements of IIoT, especially in terms of latency,
data processing capabilities, and security concerns. This
survey focuses on three prominent IoT platforms, namely
ThingsBoard [10], Eclipse Ditto [11], and Microsoft Azure
IoT [12]. These three platforms were chosen since they
offer distinct features and strengths, addressing different
requirements and use cases within the IIoT domain. In the
following subsections, the challenges of traditional IoT
platforms are discussed, followed by a brief description of the
three prominent IoT platforms and their comparison against
key IIoT requirements mentioned in Section II.
A. CHALLENGES OF TRADITIONAL IoT PLATFORMS
Traditional IoT platforms, which lack capabilities in real-time
data processing, efficient computation offloading, and integration with edge and cloud computing, are not fully
suitable for the advanced requirements of IIoT. They
struggle with the increased data volumes, computational
demands, and low-latency requirements characteristic of IIoT
environments. The challenges include handling high volumes
of data generated by industrial devices, ensuring real-time
data processing and analysis, maintaining robust security
protocols, and providing reliable connectivity in complex
industrial environments. IoT platforms that developed before
the widespread adoption of edge computing concepts might
not be fully equipped to handle the distributed computing
demands of IIoT. These platforms may primarily focus
on cloud-based data processing and lack the infrastructure
or software support for edge computing. Since they are
not designed for real-time data processing, they may fall
short in IIoT contexts, where quick decision-making is
critical. This can be a limitation in environments requiring
immediate responses based on data analysis. Besides, some
IoT platforms may not scale efficiently for the vast number of
devices and the high data volumes typical in IIoT scenarios.
Platforms not designed for high scalability might struggle
with performance issues when deployed in large-scale
industrial settings. In addition, platforms that offer limited
customization or lack integration capabilities with a wide
range of edge devices and sensors may not be suitable for
complex IIoT ecosystems, which often involve diverse types
of machinery and equipment. Furthermore, IIoT demands
robust security features due to the critical nature of industrial
data. Platforms with basic or outdated security measures
might not be adequate for IIoT applications, especially in
distributed edge-to-cloud architectures.
B. ThingsBoard
ThingsBoard is an open-source IoT platform for device
management, data collection, processing, and visualization.
It enables device connectivity via industry-standard IoT
protocols (e.g., MQTT, CoAP and HTTP). Fig. 2 shows the

cloud-native environment in its cloud computing center
to address operation and maintenance management
problems at the city level [50].
6) Blockchain Technology Integration: ThingsBoard utilizes blockchain technology to decentralize data control,
increase resilience to cyber-attacks, and automate data
collection and analysis processes for specific applications, such as farming [51]. It consists of three layers:
data acquisition and encryption in the IoT layer, ledger
creation and management in the blockchain layer, and
user interaction and farming software in the service
provider layer.
C. ECLIPSE DITTO
Eclipse Ditto operates as an innovative IoT platform focused
on creating and managing digital twins of physical devices
connected to the internet. It functions as an IoT middleware,
providing an abstraction layer that facilitates interaction
between IoT solutions and physical devices through the
digital twin pattern. This means that Eclipse Ditto allows
for the creation of virtual representations of physical
devices, enabling the control and monitoring of these devices
remotely. One of the key features of Eclipse Ditto is state
management for digital twins, where it differentiates between
reported, desired, and current states of devices. This includes
support for the synchronization and publishing of state
changes. Fig. 3 shows the architecture of Eclipse Ditto,
which contains Ditto services (policies, things, things-search,
concierge, gateway, connectivity), the externally provided
and consumed API endpoints, the external dependencies
(MongoDB and nginx) and the relations of the services to
each other [52].
Eclipse Ditto’s approach of managing digital twins offers
a streamlined and efficient way to develop industrial applications by providing a consistent and accessible API for a
wide range of devices and use cases in various domains,
as discussed below.
FIGURE 3. Eclipse ditto architecture [52].
1) mIoTwins - Private Edge Networks: Eclipse Ditto,
along with Eclipse Hono and Kubernetes, is used in
the mIoTwins framework for managing massive IoT
networks in private edge networks. This framework is
adept at adapting to heterogeneous IoT protocols and
synchronizing the status information of IoT devices to
digital twins, as demonstrated in a mobile robot use
case [53].
2) Eclipse Arrowhead Framework - Industrial Automation: Eclipse Ditto is integrated with the Eclipse
Arrowhead Framework (EAF) to create Digital Twins
as a proxy (DTaaP). This integration helps to address
challenges in industrial cyber-physical systems, such as
high energy consumption and low security, by providing
energy efficiency, availability, and security [54].
3) Digital Twin Platform in Vertical Farming Systems:
Eclipse Ditto is utilized in the design and implementation of a digital twin system for vertical farming. The
framework divides the system into three modules: the
node of a real vertical farm, the gateway, and the virtual
world of the farm as a digital twin server [55].
4) Digital Twin Broker Interface: An open-source-based
digital twin broker interface is implemented based on
Eclipse Ditto. This interface enables interaction through
data and event exchange between real and virtual
assets, as evidenced in a testbed system consisting of
Automated Mobile Robots (AMRs), a charging station,
and a conveyor interacting with a virtual crane and
forklift [56].
5) Digital Twin Network for IIoT: Eclipse Ditto is utilized to create a digital twin network for the IIoT along
with Eclipse Hono. This network creates digital replicas
of physical objects in the IIoT ecosystem, enabling
efficient management and real-time data processing of
industrial devices and systems [57].
D. MICROSOFT AZURE IoT
Microsoft Azure IoT offers a robust cloud-based platform
for device management, data analysis, and application
deployment. Azure IoT represents a collection of fully
managed services and solutions for IoT, including IoT
Hub, IoT Edge, IoT Central, IoT Solution Accelerators,
Digital Twins, Sphere, Stream Analytics on IoT Edge,
Time Series Insights, and Security Center for IoT. These
components work together to provide a complete ecosystem
for IoT solutions, supporting everything from basic device
connectivity and data processing to advanced analytics, AI,
and edge computing capabilities. Fig. 4 depicts Azure IoT
Reference Architecture, which comprises Azure components
and services that IoT solutions commonly use [58]. However,
no single solution uses all of these components. Azure IoT
solutions typically involve devices or things that generate
data, insights about the data, and actions based on insights.
For example, if a motor sends temperature data, this data
is utilized to evaluate whether the motor is performing as
expected. The insight gained about the motor’s performance
is then used to prioritize its maintenance schedule.
Microsoft Azure IoT operates as a comprehensive IoT
platform, providing a range of functionalities and services
for the effective management and analysis of IoT devices
and data. Microsoft Azure IoT’s comprehensive approach
to IoT management, encompassing device connectivity, data
analysis, security, and cloud-based operations, making it a
versatile choice for various commercial applications across
various industries, as discussed below.

a cloud service, which can be monitored on mobile
devices like smartphones or tablets, facilitating remote
monitoring and control [61].
4) It is applied in experimental edge computing systems for
smart home environments, focusing on device management, security concerns, and configuration management
patterns [62].
5) It is utilized in wearable technologies like Intelligent
Asthma Monitoring systems and Apple watches with
functionalities such as blood oxygen measuring, ECG
tracking, and irregular heartbeat detection [63].
FIGURE 4. Azure IoT reference architecture [58].
6) It finds applications in supply chain management,
product tracking, counterfeiting prevention, and agri
supply chain, offering solutions for digital homes,
offices, warehouses, manufacturing, and distribution
[64].
E. COMPARISON OF THREE IoT PLATFORMS AGAINST
KEY IIoT REQUIREMENTS
The three IoT platforms have been compared in terms of key
IIoT requirements (Section II) from the perspective of edgeto-cloud computing, as discussed below.
1) EDGE-TO-CLOUD DATA ANALYTICS
• ThingsBoard: ThingsBoard supports cloud computing
deployments through ThingsBoard Community Edition
(CE), Professional Edition (PE), and Cloud. Besides,
ThingsBoard supports edge computing deployments
through ThingsBoard Edge CE and PE. Hence, data
analytics can be performed across multiple layers from
edge to cloud.
• Eclipse Ditto: Eclipse Ditto supports lightweight and
efficient data synchronization and deduplication across
edge devices and cloud servers. It does not support
performing data analytics directly. However, it can be
integrated with a data analytics tool to leverage the
data collected from IoT devices for deeper insights and
automation.
• Microsoft Azure IoT: Microsoft Azure IoT supports
cloud computing deployments through Azure IoT, while
it supports edge computing deployments through Azure
IoT Edge. Hence, data analytics can be performed across
multiple layers from edge to cloud.
Based on our observation, ThingsBoard and Microsoft
Azure IoT support edge-to-cloud data analytics, while
Eclipse Ditto supports data synchronization and deduplication across edge devices and cloud servers.
2) PERFORMANCE
Some empirical studies explored the performance of each IoT
platform, which are as follows.
• ThingsBoard: The study in [65] presented the performance of ThingsBoard based on different deployment
scenarios. One of the deployment scenarios is standalone server deployment, which is suitable for up to
300,000 devices with 10,000 messages and 10,000 data
points per second based on real production use cases.
That scenario requires both the ThingsBoard platform
and the PostgreSQL database to be deployed within
the same server (on-premise or in the cloud). In that
deployment scenario, an average virtual environment
can handle ∼ 5, 000 telemetry data points per second.
Another deployment scenario is cluster deployment
with the Microservice Architecture (MSA) to perform
scalable deployments for millions of devices. With MSA
deployments, the system administrator can flexibly
tune the number of transport, rule engine, web UI,
and JavaScript executor microservices to optimize
the cluster according to the current load. In that
deployment scenario, a cluster of virtual machines
with 5 ThingsBoard servers and 5 Cassandra nodes can
handle 1 million devices.
• Eclipse Ditto: The study in [66] presented a benchmark
of Eclipse Ditto, conducted via the benchmark tool,
which is based on the load-testing tool K6 with the
xk6-kafka extension. The benchmark test consists of
several scenarios that can be executed independently and
in parallel. One of the test scenarios is Read Things,
which executes HTTP GET requests for reading things
by ID. That test shows that with a single instance of
each service, it is possible to perform ∼ 2800 reads/s.
Attempting more reads results in a high Garbage
Collection (GC) time and a drop in performance.
Scaling the gateway to 2 instances results in only
∼ 3500 reads/s because of the high GC time for the
things service - ∼ 5s. Scaling the things service to
2 instances results in ∼ 5600 reads/s. A maximum
of 8400 reads/s was possible with 3 gateways and
2 things instances. Another test scenario is Search
Things, which executes HTTP GET requests to search
for things by ID. In that scenario, the things-search
service is used to perform a search query for things,
based on the provided filter. That test shows that with a
single instance of each service, it is possible to perform
∼ 1700 searches/s. Attempting more searches results
in a high GC time and a drop in performance. With
a single instance of the things service and 2 instances
of gateway service, a maximum of ∼ 2400 searches/s
can be performed, with a high GC time for the things
service - ∼ 3s. Scaling things to 2 instances results
in ∼ 3400 searches/s. Scaling to 3 gateways does
not show expected performance because the nodes
things pods run on have high CPU usage - ∼ 90%.
To perform more searches, nodes with more CPUs are
needed.
• Microsoft Azure IoT: The study in [67] tested the
performance of Microsoft Azure IoT Hub using a
massive synthetic workload generated by the Clemson
supercomputer. To simulate large-scale manufacturing
workloads, that study tested a large number of client
sensors executing on 40 core nodes and sending to
Azure IoT Hub within throttling limits. One of their
trials consisted of 1000 sensors placed on 1, 2, or
4 computing nodes, each sending messages to an IoT
Hub with a single B3 unit. The messages had a constant
InterMessage gap Times (IMT) of 200 ms, which was
5000 messages per second in total. This is close to,
but never exceeding, the throttling limit (6000 msg/sec).
All trial runs lasted 90 minutes and sent a total of
27,000,000 messages. Each Cumulative Distribution
Function (CDF) follows the same curve with a 66%
probability of latency under 50 ms, an 85% probability
of latency under 100 ms, a 95% probability of latency
under 200 ms, and a 99% probability of latency under
300 ms.
Based on our observation, the empirical studies of
ThingsBoard’s and Eclipse Dittos’ performance evaluation
focused on demonstrating the platform’s capability of efficient resource utilization. In contrast, the empirical study
of Microsoft Azure IoT’s performance evaluation focused
on demonstrating the platform’s capability to handle high
throughput with low latency.
3) SCALABILITY
• ThingsBoard: ThingsBoard is horizontally scalable.
It can be easily scaled out or in to handle increasing or
decreasing workloads. It can be deployed on-premises
or in the cloud, and it supports a variety of hardware and
software configurations.
• Eclipse Ditto: Eclipse Ditto is also horizontally scalable
and can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud.
It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making
it a good choice for small to medium-sized IoT
deployments.
• Microsoft Azure IoT: Microsoft Azure IoT is also
scalable for cloud-based deployments. It allows to scale
up or down resources according to needs.
Based on our observation, all three platforms are claimed to
be scalable. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no
scalability evaluation covering the scaling to a large number
of nodes.
4) INTEROPERABILITY
• ThingsBoard: ThingsBoard supports a wide variety
of protocols and data formats, making it interoperable
with a wide range of IoT devices and applications.
It also supports a variety of security features, including
authentication, authorization, and encryption.
• Eclipse Ditto: Eclipse Ditto is also interoperable and
supports a variety of protocols and data formats. It is
particularly well-suited for applications that require a
unified view of data from multiple sources.
• Microsoft Azure IoT: Microsoft Azure IoT also
supports a wide variety of protocols and data formats,
including MQTT, AMQP, HTTPS, and CoAP.
Based on our observation, ThingsBoard and Microsoft Azure
IoT support a slightly wider range of protocols and data
formats than Eclipse Ditto, which is primarily focused on
lightweight and efficient data synchronization.
5) FAULT-TOLERANCE AND RESILIENCY
• ThingsBoard: ThingsBoard provides built-in failover
capabilities to ensure high availability. If a node or
service fails, ThingsBoard will automatically reroute
traffic to another node or service. This ensures that
applications and devices continue to function even in
the event of a failure. Besides, it is designed to be
resilient to network outages and other disruptions. It can
automatically re-connect to devices and services after
a disruption, and it will also automatically retry failed
commands.
• Eclipse Ditto: Eclipse Ditto also provides built-in
failover capabilities. When a node or service fails,
Ditto will automatically re-create the digital twin and
data from the failed node or service. This ensures
that applications and devices continue to function
with minimal disruption. Besides, it is designed to be
resilient to network outages and other disruptions. It will
automatically reconnect to device brokers and services
after a disruption, and it will also automatically retry
failed commands.
• Microsoft Azure IoT: Microsoft Azure IoT also provides built-in failover capabilities for high availability,
including automatic rerouting of traffic to healthy nodes.
It is designed to be resilient to network outages and
disruptions, with features like data replication and
automatic reconnection.
Based on our observation, ThingsBoard has the most
robust failover mechanism, with multiple built-in failover
techniques and resilience to network outages and other
disruptions. Eclipse Ditto and Microsoft Azure IoT also
have failover mechanisms, but they are not as comprehensive
as ThingsBoard’s. In addition, ThingsBoard and Microsoft
Azure IoT are more resilient than Eclipse Ditto, with features
like data replication and automatic reconnection that help to
keep applications running even in the event of disruptions.
They are also more flexible in the types of disruptions they
can handle.
6) SECURITY
• ThingsBoard: ThingsBoard provides strong security
features. It supports various authentication mechanisms including username/password, JSON Web Tokens
(JWT), and X.509 certificates. However, phishing
attacks can still bypass these measures if users
reveal their credentials. ThingsBoard allows defining
fine-grained access control policies based on user
roles and permissions. Users can be assigned specific
permissions to access resources and perform actions
within the system. Administrators can configure access
policies to restrict or allow access to specific resources
based on user roles. It also supports data encryption
in transit using TLS/SSL protocols to secure communication between clients and the server, as well
as allows encryption of stored data at rest (platformspecific mechanisms). But, encryption alone cannot
prevent attacks that exploit software vulnerabilities or
human error.
• Eclipse Ditto: Eclipse Ditto also provides good security
features. It offers authentication through OAuth 2.0,
client certificates, and HTTP Basic authentication.
However, it remains susceptible to social engineering
attacks like phishing. Eclipse Ditto offers flexible access
control policies that can be defined based on attributes
of digital twins. It enables defining fine-grained access
policies for individual resources such as devices, twins,
or messages. Besides, it utilizes TLS/SSL encryption
for securing communication between clients and the
server. It also supports encryption of data at rest using
encryption mechanisms provided by the underlying
storage system. However, it doesn’t eliminate the risk
of attacks that target software vulnerabilities.
• Microsoft Azure IoT: Microsoft Azure IoT provides
rich security features. Azure IoT Hub supports device
authentication through symmetric keys, X.509 certificates, and SAS tokens. It also provides integration
with Azure Active Directory for user authentication.
However, phishing attacks can still compromise credentials. Microsoft Azure IoT offers Role-Based Access
Control (RBAC), which enables administrators to define
granular access policies for accessing IoT resources.
It supports defining access policies based on roles and
scopes for managing device access. Hence, users and
devices can be assigned roles with specific permissions
to perform operations on IoT Hub resources. Besides,
it implements TLS/SSL encryption for securing data
in transit between devices and IoT Hub. It also offers
encryption of data at rest using Azure Key Vault
integration for managing encryption keys. However,
security requires a layered approach beyond encryption.
Based on our observation, all three platforms provide
good security features. While they offer a robust set of
security features, they are not invincible to determined
attackers. A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack can overwhelm
the platform with a flood of traffic, rendering it inaccessible
to legitimate users. Mitigating DoS attacks requires careful
network configuration and traffic filtering techniques [68].
Phishing emails or deceptive websites can trick users
into revealing login credentials or installing malware that
compromises their devices. Security awareness training can
help users identify and avoid such attacks [69]. While the
platforms themselves may encrypt data at rest, vulnerabilities
in the underlying database software could create an entry
point for attackers. Hence, keeping database software up-todate with security patches is crucial [70].
7) EASE OF DEPLOYMENT
• ThingsBoard: ThingsBoard offers relatively easy
deployment options. It can be deployed both on-premises
and on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and
Azure. ThingsBoard provides Docker images, which
simplify deployment and management across different
environments. Additionally, ThingsBoard offers a
Kubernetes deployment option for scalable and efficient
deployment in containerized environments. In addition,
ThingsBoard IoT Gateway allows to integrate devices
connected to legacy and third-party systems with
ThingsBoard [71].
• Eclipse Ditto: Eclipse Ditto provides a flexible deployment process. It is designed to run in various
environments, including on-premises, cloud, or edge.
Ditto offers Docker images for simplified deployment,
enabling users to easily set up and manage instances.
However, compared to some other platforms, Ditto
might require more configuration and setup effort due
to its focus on flexibility and customization.
• Microsoft Azure IoT: Azure IoT provides a range of
deployment options designed to accommodate different
use cases and preferences. It offers a fully managed
cloud service, Azure IoT Hub, which simplifies deployment by handling infrastructure management tasks such
as scaling, monitoring, and maintenance automatically.
Users can provision IoT Hub instances through the
Azure portal with just a few clicks. Additionally, Azure
IoT Edge extends deployment capabilities to the edge,
allowing users to run IoT workloads closer to the data
source for reduced latency and improved efficiency.
Azure IoT Edge provides Docker container support for
deploying and managing modules, making it relatively
straightforward to deploy custom logic to edge devices.
In addition, legacy and third-party systems can be
connected to Azure IoT using CloudRail [72].
Based on our observation, all three platforms offer relatively
easy deployment options, but the level of simplicity may
vary depending on the specific requirements and preferences
of the users. ThingsBoard and Azure IoT provide managed
cloud services with straightforward provisioning processes,
while Eclipse Ditto offers more flexibility in deployment
environments, which may require additional configuration
but can be advantageous for certain use cases requiring
customization.
8) OVERALL COMPARISON
• ThingsBoard: A powerful and versatile IoT platform
that is well-suited for enterprise deployments. It is
highly scalable, interoperable, and resilient and provides
a wide range of features, a user-friendly dashboard,
and a rule engine. Though ThingsBoard CE and
ThingsBoard Edge CE are 100% open-source and
free to use, some advanced features are not available
such as organizing entities into groups, assigning roles
to specific user groups, scheduling various types of
events with flexible configuration, platform integrations,
white-labeling, and domain management, while these
features are available in ThingsBoard PE, ThingsBoard
Cloud, and ThingsBoard Edge PE, but they are based on
different subscription plans.
• Eclipse Ditto: A lightweight and efficient open-source
framework for creating and managing digital twins in the
IoT. It is interoperable and resilient, provides a unified
view of data from multiple sources, and is well-suited
for small to medium-sized deployments. Though it is
100% open-source and free to use, it is not as powerful
and feature-rich as other platforms and may not be
suitable for large-scale enterprise deployments. Besides,
it has limitations in terms of ready-made visualization
features. Integration with non-Eclipse systems may also
present challenges.
• Microsoft Azure IoT: A comprehensive IoT platform
for cloud-based deployments. It is scalable, interoperable, and resilient and provides a wide range of
features and capabilities. However, it is not open-source
and not as lightweight as other platforms. Besides,
it is cost-intensive for on-premises deployments and
may be complex to deploy and manage for small- to
medium-sized edge deployments.
To summarize, the best platform will depend on specific
needs and requirements. If a powerful and versatile platform
for enterprise deployments is needed, ThingsBoard is a good
choice. Eclipse Ditto is a good choice if a lightweight and
efficient platform for small to medium-sized deployments is
needed to perform efficient data synchronization and deduplication. And if a comprehensive platform for cloud-based
deployments is needed, Microsoft Azure IoT is a good choice.
Table 1 summarizes the key differences among the three IoT
platforms.
IV. IDENTIFIED CHALLENGES AND POTENTIAL
RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES
In this section, we identify key challenges and potential
research opportunities derived from our comparative analysis
of three prominent IoT platforms - ThingsBoard, Eclipse
Ditto, and Microsoft Azure IoT - in the context of the IIoT
requirements. Building on the insights from previous discussions, we highlight areas that warrant further investigation to
enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of IIoT deployments.
The identified research challenges and potential research
opportunities are as follows.
A. PERFORMANCE AND SCALABILITY
Scalability remains a critical challenge in IIoT, particularly
as the number of connected devices continues to grow exponentially. While platforms like ThingsBoard and Microsoft
Azure IoT claim high scalability, empirical evaluations indicate that performance can degrade under heavy loads [65],
[67]. Research is needed to develop more efficient algorithms
and architectures that can handle millions of devices without
performance bottlenecks. Additionally, exploring hybrid
edge-cloud solutions that dynamically allocate resources
based on real-time demand can enhance scalability and
performance [73].
B. SEMANTIC INTEROPERABILITY
Interoperability among heterogeneous IoT devices and platforms is crucial for seamless data exchange and integration.
Although platforms such as ThingsBoard and Microsoft
Azure IoT support multiple protocols and data formats, the
lack of semantic interoperability, which involves understanding the context and meaning of exchanged data, is a area that
requires further exploration [74].
C. SECURITY AND PRIVACY
Security and privacy are paramount in IIoT applications, where sensitive industrial data is often transmitted
and stored. Despite robust security features in existing
platforms, vulnerabilities still exist, particularly against
sophisticated cyber-attacks such as Denial-of-Service (DoS)
TABLE 1. Comparison of three IoT platforms against key IIoT requirements.
and phishing [75]. Research should aim to enhance security
frameworks through advanced encryption techniques and
machine learning algorithms for threat detection and
response [76], [77].
D. DATA ANALYTICS AND EDGE COMPUTING
The integration of data analytics across edge and cloud
environments poses significant challenges. While platforms
like ThingsBoard and Microsoft Azure IoT support edge-tocloud data analytics, there is a need for more efficient data
processing frameworks that minimize latency and optimize
resource usage [78]. Research should investigate novel edge
computing paradigms, such as federated learning, which
allows model training across decentralized edge devices without centralized data aggregation, thus enhancing data privacy
and reducing latency [79]. Besides, research should focus on
developing lightweight AI models that can be deployed on
edge devices, enabling local data processing and reducing
the need for constant cloud connectivity [80]. Moreover,
analyzing a sensor’s accuracy in an edge environment is
another research opportunity, which could be beneficial in
determining if the performance of the sensor has degraded
due to some external means (dust covering the sensor, manual
tampering, etc.) or hardware issues.
E. RESILIENCE AND FAULT TOLERANCE
Ensuring system resilience and fault tolerance in IIoT
environments is critical for maintaining continuous operation
and minimizing downtime. Although existing platforms offer
various failover mechanisms, more research is required to
develop adaptive systems that can predict and proactively
mitigate potential failures [81]. Exploring self-healing architectures and leveraging artificial intelligence for predictive
maintenance can significantly enhance system resilience and
fault tolerance [82], [83].
F. EASE OF DEPLOYMENT
Ease of deployment is crucial for the efficient and effective
integration of IIoT systems across industrial settings, which
involves minimizing the complexity, time, and resources
required to implement and manage IIoT devices (as well
as devices connected to legacy and third-party systems).
Although platforms such as ThingsBoard and Microsoft
Azure IoT allow integration of devices connected to legacy
and third-party systems to some extent [71], [72], integrating
legacy IIoT edge devices such as SCADA systems, ICS, and
PLCs, which often have minimal computational resources,
security features, and interoperability capabilities, poses
significant challenges. Legacy devices were not designed to
handle the complex computational requirements of modern
IIoT systems, limiting their ability to support advanced
functionalities such as real-time data analytics and processing [84]. Hence, developing lightweight middleware and
edge computing solutions that offload processing tasks from
legacy devices to more capable edge nodes can enhance their
functionality without necessitating hardware upgrades [78].
Besides, many legacy devices lack robust security mechanisms, making them susceptible to cyber-attacks. Ensuring
the security of these devices when integrated into modern
IIoT systems is a significant concern [85]. Hence, designing
secure gateways and proxy servers that provide encryption,
authentication, and intrusion detection can protect legacy
devices within IIoT environments [86]. Moreover, legacy
devices often use proprietary protocols and data formats,
complicating their integration with modern IIoT platforms
that rely on standardized communication protocols [87].
Hence, developing protocol translation mechanisms and
interoperability frameworks can bridge the gap between
legacy systems and contemporary IIoT platforms. There are
also proposals for digital twin as a proxy [88], where a digital
counterpart fronts resource-constrained device(s) and works
as a proxy that provides services while a device may sleep,
caters for security that may be costly, and provides standard
service-oriented internet protocols to surrounding systems
while on the other side having the device-specific (possibly
legacy) protocols needed to interface the device(s). Furthermore, integrating and managing data from heterogeneous
legacy devices is complex due to differences in data formats,
communication protocols, and data quality [89]. Hence,
developing unified data management platforms that support
heterogeneous data integration, cleansing, and preprocessing
can address these challenges. Research can also investigate
data harmonization techniques to ensure consistent and
high-quality data across IIoT systems [90].
V. CONCLUSION
The transformative impact of IIoT on industrial operations
is ushering in an era of increased automation, efficiency,
and data-driven decision-making. Distributed edge-to-cloud
computing is a rapidly evolving field with the potential
to revolutionize the way IIoT applications are deployed
and managed. This article has provided a comprehensive
overview of the role of distributed edge-to-cloud computing
in the context of IIoT. It identifies key IIoT requirements
from the perspective of edge-to-cloud computing and compares the capabilities of three leading IoT platforms in
addressing these requirements. The comparison of these
platforms across key IIoT requirements revealed insights
into their performance, scalability, interoperability, fault
tolerance, data analytics capabilities, security features, and
deployment options. Each platform demonstrated strengths
and considerations, catering to different needs within the
IIoT domain. Besides, the identified open challenges and
potential research opportunities underscore the importance
of advancing IIoT systems. Addressing scalability and performance bottlenecks, achieving semantic interoperability,
and enhancing security frameworks are crucial steps forward.
Innovations in edge computing, lightweight AI models,
and self-healing architectures can further strengthen IIoT
deployments. Simplifying the integration of legacy systems
and ensuring system resilience will also be vital for broader
adoption. In essence, this article provides a valuable resource
for researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers in the field
of IIoT, offering insights into the capabilities of leading IoT
platforms and outlining directions for future research and
development in the dynamic landscape of distributed edgeto-cloud computing for industrial applications.
