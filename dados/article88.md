Title: FOGAAL: A Domain-Specific Language for Fog Computing in Ambient Assisted Living Environments

Abstract:
The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized numerous sectors, with healthcare being a prominent beneficiary. One key area of advancement is Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), which leverages Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) like IoT to improve the quality of life for vulnerable populations, particularly seniors. However, despite efforts to tailor solutions to the needs of these environments, the prevailing approach often becomes overly focused on intricate implementation details rather than the core characteristics of the problem domain. This narrow focus inhibits generalization and leads to unsustainable solutions due to these environments’ diverse, dynamic, and scalable nature. In response, emerging technology paradigms, such as Fog Computing (FC), have emerged to enhance performance and other quality aspects. FC enables the deployment of distributed, latency-aware applications and services. Therefore, this paper introduces FOGAAL, a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) tool crafted to design AAL architectures, including the FC advantages. To demonstrate FOGAAL’s practical applicability, this contribution uses FOGAAL to build an AAL architecture for a real scenario; in addition, it has an empirical evaluation employing the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to gauge user perceptions while utilizing the tool for modeling AAL Architectures. The evaluation, conducted as a quasi-experiment, underscore the tool’s alignment with requirements and its potential for adoption, as evidenced by software engineers who have expressed their intention to use FOGAAL when creating architecture for AAL environments.

The Fog Computing (FC) paradigm offers a powerful alternative to improve Internet of Things (IoT) applications across various sectors, including Healthcare. A notable example is Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), where FC capabilities can significantly enhance performance by reducing latency and improving response times-critical factors for such applications. A key challenge in this field is the lack of a standardized way to represent and characterize the diverse elements within AAL systems that leverage FC. To address this, a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) has been developed. This DSL aims to simplify the design of AAL solutions

SECTION I.Introduction
The Internet of Things (IoT) constitutes a dynamic global network infrastructure facilitating the connection of uniquely identifiable ‘Things’ to the Internet, accessible anytime and anywhere. This infrastructure has promoted the development of novel applications across diverse emerging domains, including smart cities, transportation, energy, industry, business, and healthcare. The capabilities of these devices, encompassing sensing, storage, processing (analysis), and actuation, foster this rapid expansion [1], [2].

Although conventional IoT applications commonly process and store data on the Cloud, a technology well-suited for providing on-demand computing resources that complement IoT requirements [3], [4], it is not always optimal to channel, store, and process all data on the cloud due to various factors. They include cost implications, performance considerations, the abundance of irrelevant information, and network congestion resulting from the vast data generated by IoT applications [5], [6]. Consequently, a new paradigm, Fog Computing (FC), has emerged to address these challenges by enabling the deployment of distributed, latency-aware applications and services for IoT [7], [8]. FC is an intermediary layer between smart-end devices and cloud-centralized services, facilitating decentralized, latency-sensitive processing and storage tasks within the network without third-party intervention. These tasks support critical network functions or enable the development of new services and applications in IoT, thereby complementing Cloud services without replacing them [9].

Healthcare is a compelling domain within IoT research and application, demanding real-time processing, high availability, and rapid response capabilities to events. FC efficiently meets these requirements [8], [10]. Integrating sensors, wearables, wireless communications, and medical device design advancements in remote health monitoring, chronic disease assistance, and care for vulnerable populations have showcased significant improvements for individuals [11], [12]. Here, Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) emerges as a focus in developing intelligent environments that aim to enhance older people’s life quality and independence by providing affordable, accessible, and sustainable solutions [13], [14], [15].

Another critical aspect within the IoT landscape that has been progressively addressed is the implementation of specification solutions, such as Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs). These specialized problem-oriented languages offer higher-level abstraction primitives that can encompass the unique characteristics of the concrete studied domain, simplifying application development [16], [17], [18]. Given the intricate heterogeneity of interconnected devices in IoT applications, there is a pressing need for DSLs with high-level visual syntax and specialized semantics to aid developers in constructing IoT solutions across various domains [18], including AAL.

Although several DSLs are oriented towards IoT, Healthcare, or AAL [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45] (see Table 1), these DSLs face certain limitations. They either lack intermediate nodes, as provided by FC, mix IoT-FC in AAL, or fail to align with established standards, such as those proposed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [7] or the SOPRANO ontology [46], which offer standard conceptual semantics concerning FC and AAL environments, respectively. It is essential to mention that an ontology-based approach to knowledge representation enables uncovering interesting patterns, providing valuable insights into data while promoting data replicability, reproducibility, and reuse [47].

TABLE 1 Related DSLs Features (●: Addressed; (☾: Partially-Addressed; ◯: Non-Addressed)
Table 1- Related DSLs Features (●: Addressed; (☾: Partially-Addressed; ◯: Non-Addressed)
Therefore, to address these needs, this paper presents i) FOGAAL, a DSL designed to empower developers in architecting AAL environments that incorporate IoT features and FC, aligning with the NIST FC conceptual model [7], and the SOPRANO ontology [46] to provide a common language in this context; ii) an experimental scenario that depicts FOGAAL’s use in real-world scenarios; and iii) a controlled quasi-experiment involving a group of software engineers designing a proposed architecture using FOGAAL [48], [49]. Subsequently, user perception was addressed using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) [50].

The paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the Related Work, Section III describes the FOGAAL DSL, Section IV showcases an illustrative experimental scenario demonstrating the use of the proposed approach for modeling an AAL environment, Section V presents the empirical evaluation of FOGAAL, Section VI states the advantages and limitations of this DSL, and finally Section VII provides the conclusions and outlines further research steps.

SECTION II.Related Work
The DSLs are increasingly used in emergent domains and research to address an effective semantic to describe specific solutions. Also, they help bring developers and technicians closer to users who are experts in the domain. Therefore, DSLs facilitate understanding aspects to be included in the final applications and software solutions, in this case, in an assisted living environment. However, while the FC expands within IoT, its representation in DSLs remains relatively underreported [16], [17], [18]. Additionally, the lack of DSLs customized for specific application domains, such as the AAL, is conspicuous. This section presents and scrutinizes IoT-oriented DSLs from the last decade, with particular attention to those related to AAL or the healthcare domain. Then, a total of 27 studies were selected, divided into one solution in the industry, and 26 papers (including one relevant paper from 2012) were selected from IEEE Xplore, Springer Link, Science Direct, and ACM digital libraries by using the following search string:

Domain-Specific Language AND (Internet of Things OR Fog Computing OR Ambient Assisted Living OR Healthcare).

Table 1 presents the analysis of the selected papers, summarizing their contributions and weaknesses compared to the FOGAAL DSL. The evaluated criteria consist of several characteristics: whether the study presents a DSL based on Graphical Syntax (Graphical User Interface), considers IoT and/or FC features, focuses on the healthcare or AAL domain, aligns with a technical standard, and if an evaluation process of the DSL tool is presented.

The selected works encompass several DSLs tailored for various domains, but none directly address the fusion of IoT and FC with AAL environments as proposed in FOGAAL. RELAX by Ahmad et al. [19] initiates DSL exploration in healthcare, particularly AAL, though it lacks technical depth. Midgar by García et al. [20], [21], [22] streamlines IoT application creation but lacks FC integration. Eterovic et al. [23], [24] offer DSL-4-IoT, emphasizing IoT complexities management but overlooking FC and AAL specifics. VR-MED by Mossmann et al. [25] focuses on medical scenarios but excludes AAL and IoT elements. Alves et al. [26] present a Building Information Modeling Sensor Language(BIMSL), an IoT DSL based on ISO 9241–11 and ISO/IEC 25010, specifically focused on effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, and usability attributes. Negash et al. [27] proposed DoS-IL, a domain-specific Internet of Things Language for resource-constrained Devices based on a client-server-server-client architecture. Gyrard et al. [28] does not present a specific DSL; however, the article demonstrates how ontologies can be used to design and develop innovative city applications, considering four relevant ontology catalogs for IoT and smart cities.Åkesson et al. [29] introduce ComPOS, a domain-specific language for composing IoT services into systems, and propose a strategy called abort to improve the time to send messages. SiMoNa by Morais et al. [30] focuses on IoT infographics but not AAL intricacies. Godfrey [31] propose participatory modeling based on a suite of DSLs that involve users directly in model development to resolve issues in a healthcare context. Moin et al. [32] used an open-source, domain-specific language and modeling tool called ThingML to implement and validate an approach to enhance the development of smart services for the IoT and smart Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). CAAMIL by Shekhovtsov et al. [33] emphasizes data exchange but lacks detailed AAL and IoT integration. Triton by Wood and Azim [34] targets Cyber-Physical Systems without AAL emphasis. OntoIoT by Negm et al. [35] automates IoT application development but lacks holistic IoT architecture. SimulateIoT and SimulateIoT-FIWARE by Barriga et al. [36], [37] incorporate Edge properties but lack complete Cloud structures. Erazo-Garzón et al. [38] propose Monitor-IoT, a DSL that supports developers in designing multi-layer monitoring architectures for IoT systems. Monitor-IoT comprises a high-level visual modeling language and a metamodel aligned with the ISO/IEC 30141:2018 reference architecture. Damiani et al. [39] introduce a Virtual Sensor DSL built on C++ for designing and developing Computer-Aided Design tools and Integrated Development Environments; this DSL focused on data collection, technology mapping, and workload distribution. Li et al. [40] propose IoTECS, a DSL for generating edge-to-cloud simulators; this DSL is implemented in an industrial context to evaluate its usefulness. Mouine and Saeid [41] focus on healthcare systems but overlook AAL and detailed networking. Erazo-Garzon et al. [42] propose a DSL and a model-based transformation engine to design and automatically implement IoT dashboard visualization web applications; this solution abstracts implementation details from heterogeneous data sources (physical and virtual sensors), making them transparent to domain experts. Alulema et al. [43] present a comprehensive IoT integration DSL but lack FC and AAL integration. SSDL by Ruiz-Torrubiano et al. [44] aims at smart service systems in smart cities but lacks AAL and FC features. In addition, industrial solutions such as IBM Foghorn Systems [45] focus on IoT applications with FC elements like Complex Event Processing (CEP), using DSL as the core of the development, but lacking AAL.

The collective contributions of various DSLs have paved the way for FOGAAL, which integrates IoT and FC architectures with AAL environments, addressing existing gaps. Existing DSLs offer advancements in abstracting IoT domains, aiding sectors like Healthcare, but they fall short in two crucial aspects. Firstly, many lack detailed abstraction of the FC layer, hindering comprehensive integration of FC benefits. Secondly, they often lack domain-specific focus adaptable to AAL design and fail to provide a comprehensive abstraction of the AAL domain necessary for IoT architecture interoperability and to align developments with existing standards such as NIST or SOPRANO. Consequently, FOGAAL aims to bridge these gaps by providing a comprehensive DSL solution for designing FC architectures in AAL environments.

The evaluations lack rigor in user acceptance and experimentation, with limited focus on usability and intention to use the tool from the user’s perspective. Reliance on specific cases may limit validity and generalizability. Systematic user acceptance testing and experiments are crucial for enhancing the evaluation process for a new DSL solution like FOGAAL. This involves gathering feedback through controlled experiments, assessing usability and usefulness, and iteratively refining the DSL based on user input, ensuring it meets user needs effectively.

SECTION III.FOGAAL: A Domain Specific Language Tool for Designing Ambient Assisted Living Architectures
This section introduces the FOGAAL DSL tool, designed to streamline the modeling of AAL architectures based on environmental conditions and user requirements. Leveraging the advantages of IoT and FC ecosystems and their associated characteristics (e.g., devices, fog nodes, and cloud services). FOGAAL DSL aims to efficiently manage essential elements in FC and AAL domains by aligning with two key technical standards for domain abstraction:

SOPRANO context ontology for AAL. The SOPRANO ontology is a formal specification for the vocabulary used in the AAL context [11], [46]. This ontology ensures semantic consistency and facilitates communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders. In this paper, the SOPRANO ontology has been slightly modified, as presented in Fig. 1, to further adapt to the FC context and support multiple environments (e.g., a senior facility with three rooms). This adaptation establishes a robust framework for addressing the architectural distribution of locations and their environments, considering the persons or human actors (e.g., doctors, patients, caretakers) and seamlessly integrating sensors, actuators, and services within intelligent environments. These modifications enhance semantic coherence and enable effortless interoperability through a unified vocabulary, laying the groundwork for the development of FOGAAL

NIST FC conceptual model. FOGAAL design is based on the NIST specifications for FC. This conceptual model facilitates the construction, enhancement, or extension of FC layers, providing a common and cohesive vocabulary for domain experts such as developers, practitioners, and researchers [7]. Additionally, the NIST standard presents an FC architecture within the Cloud-based ecosystem, encompassing intelligent end devices. In this study, the NIST architecture is adapted to the healthcare domain, as shown in Fig 2.

Moreover, implementing FOGAAL DSL requires specific technical specifications to support the tool’s development. FOGAAL adheres to Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) principles, which are crucial for standardizing terminology within the application domain, thereby facilitating the creation of an effective DSL [51], [52]. The solution is coded in Java within the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE) 2019 or upper and is complemented by Obeo Designer from the SIRIUS project [53]. This setup automatically generates code and tools based on models, including graphical representations derived from the specific domain context [54], [55]. Furthermore, the hardware needed for this implementation is not demanding, as it only needs to support the Java IDE and associated tools.

A. FOGAAL Metamodel
This subsection introduces FOGAAL’s metamodel, which was developed using Obeo Designer. This metamodel is central to constructing the DSL. Figure 3 illustrates the metaclasses, attributes, and relationships of FOGAAL’s model, aligned with the SOPRANO ontology [11], [46], and the NIST FC Conceptual Model [7]. This alignment facilitates the integration of FC and AAL features into a cohesive abstract syntax, covering devices, sensors, actuators, ambient environments, network connections (i.e., cloud-fog-device), and stakeholders. The primary metaclasses are described below.

FIGURE 3. - FOGAAL metamodel.
FIGURE 3.
FOGAAL metamodel.

Show All

1) Project
Describes the created project, encompassing the AAL architecture with support for FC. See Fig. 3 (1).

2) Environment
Specifies the environment type (e.g., house, room, playroom) capable of hosting Fog Nodes or Fog Devices. Refer to Fig. 3 (2, 28).

3) User
This abstract metaclass defines the users interacting with the AAL environment. Users can include Doctors, Nurses, Patients, or Administrators. See Fig. 3 (3-5, 31).

4) Fog Node
The Fog Nodes (FNs) are the FC core elements. They can be physical (e.g., gateway, switch, router, server) or virtual (e.g., virtual switch, virtual machine, cloudlet). FNs link with smart end devices and access networks, offering computing resources based on service models such as Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) [7]. These resources support data processing, storage, and communication. Virtual and physical nodes can be deployed across private, community, and public models [7]. FNs may store a database summary, mainly the medical records and profiles of patients. They also establish direct Cloud-FNs communication to exchange data and process results. See Fig. 3 (6-8, 26, 27, 29-30).

5) Fog Device
This metaclass categorizes the devices managing components within the FC architecture (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi, LoRA). Their Communication Protocol attribute can be tailored to various types (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, ZigBee, NFC, RFID) [7], [46]. See Fig. 3 (9, 23).

6) IoT
This metaclass represents objects within AAL, including sensors (e.g., infrared, pulses) or actuators exchanging data with IoT devices. They possess attributes like Standard Type and Unity Type. Examples include assistive devices, ambient, and vital signs sensors. See Fig. 3 (10-12, 21-22, 32).

7) Cloud
This metaclass represents Cloud platforms with SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS models. Information flow between Fog Devices and Cloud nodes occurs via the Application Protocol attribute, which belongs to specific types (e.g., MQTT, COAP, HTTP, WAMP, AMQP, XMPP). See Fig. 3 (13, 24, 29).

8) Link
This abstract metaclass inherits attributes and relationships among all “Link” subclasses, enabling communication between architectural components (e.g., Fog Node-Cloud, Fog Node-Fog Node, Fog Node-Fog Device, Cloud-Fog Device, Fog Device-Fog Device, Fog Device-IoT) [7]. It includes an attribute specifying the Data Format Type transmitted between these elements. See Fig. 3 (14-20, 25).

B. FOGAAL DSL Tool
The Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a key feature of the FOGAAL DSL. Using Obeo Designer, the required models are efficiently generated and the graphical syntax within the Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF) [55] is implemented. The graphical representations or iconography of the FOGAAL DSL components, detailed in Table 2, integrate seamlessly with the metamodel code for GMF generation within Obeo Designer.

SECTION IV.AAL Architecture Design Process via FOGAAL
Implementing a systematic task execution process ensures precise outcomes guided by consistent guidelines. A process flowchart, sequenced according to the Software and Systems Process Engineering Metamodel (SPEM) specification [56], is presented for designing FC architectures in AAL environments using FOGAAL (see Fig. 4). Then, an AAL experimental scenario using the FOGAAL DSL is developed by following the presented process.

Stage 1: Collect AAL requirements. This initial stage involves gathering AAL requirements and understanding both the main environmental features (e.g., hospital) and their sub-environments (e.g., Room, Play Room).

Stage 2: Translation to technical requirements. The AAL architect translates these requirements into technical specifications by extracting hardware requirements (e.g., necessary sensors, actuators, data types, and priorities) and network requirements based on their expertise, resulting in the output of this stage.

Stage 3: Selecting hardware elements in the FOGAAL DSL tool palette. Here, the AAL architect utilizes the hardware requirements and FOGAAL DSL inputs to define representations for all considered hardware elements within the FOGAAL tool palette.

Stage 4: Designing AAL and network architecture. The final stage involves designing the AAL and network architecture. The AAL architect uses hardware element representations, network requirements, and FOGAAL DSL to generate the output artifact. This facilitates specifying network features such as communication protocols, hardware devices (e.g., fog nodes, IoT devices, actuators), and data flow using the tool.

A. Experimental Scenario: Applying FOGAAL DSL in Geriatric Center Solution Design
This subsection demonstrates the application of FOGAAL DSL through a specific experimental scenario. It addresses the need to design an effective AAL environment, capitalizing on the FC benefits. The experimentation follows the steps for designing AAL architectures, with each stage detailed below.

AAL Requirements Collection: The proposed AAL scenario involves a geriatric center requiring three dedicated patient monitoring rooms: a vital signs room, a playroom, and a restroom. Each room is equipped with specific sensors and FC nodes for data management, as well as connections to the broader network, as presented in the general requirements description in Fig. 5.

FIGURE 5. - Experimental scenario, general requirements description.
FIGURE 5.
Experimental scenario, general requirements description.

Show All

Transformation to AAL Technical Requirements: The technical needs for this AAL experimental scenario are outlined for each environment shown in Fig. 5 as follows:

1) Main Environment (M1)
The main environment represents the geriatric center, which houses the entire AAL architecture. Within this environment, there are three sub-environments: E1 (Vital Signs Monitoring Room), E2 (Playroom), and E3 (Restroom). M1 hosts the FC Layer, comprising the following components:

Fog Node. This Samsung ARTIK [57] FN concentrates, processes, and stores data collected from each sub-environment using a Wi-Fi connection. The device will receive data in HL7 medical data standard [58], [59], as it consolidates information from the entire environment.

Two Cloud Services. The AAL environment requires SaaS and PaaS Cloud services. The Samsung ARTIK FN transmits data to these Cloud services through the central router, using MQTT protocol with HL7 data format and CoAP protocol with HL7 standard, respectively.

2) Environment (E1)
The E1 environment constitutes a vital sign monitoring room within M1. This room comprises:

Fog Node. This Raspberry Pi [60] FN receives and processes data from devices within E1 and transmits data via Wi-Fi to the primary ARTIK FN. Additionally, it receives data from devices over Wi-Fi in the HL7 format.

Two Fog Devices. These are two Arduino [61] devices monitoring patients vital signs. The first device monitors blood pressure and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, with sensed values transmitted in JSON format via NFC/RFID and Bluetooth, respectively. The second device monitors sensed oxygen saturation, transmitted in JSON format via Wi-Fi.

3) Environment (E2)
The E2 environment is a Playroom within M1. This room is equipped with:

Fog Node. This Raspberry Pi FN monitors environmental parameters through a sensor and emits alerts via an alarm in case of abnormal readings. Both data and alerts are transmitted via Bluetooth in JSON format. In addition, this FN communicates data in HL7 format via Wi-Fi to the primary ARTIK FN.

Two Fog Devices. These are a smartwatch Fog Device that monitors the patient’s cardiac activity and an Intelligent Pillbox device [62], [63] that monitors patient medication tracking. Both Fog Devices transmit their data via Wi-Fi to the primary ARTIK FN in HL7 format.

4) Environment (E3)
The E3 environment is a restroom within M1. This room is equipped with:

Fog Node. This Raspberry Pi FN receives and processes data collected via Wi-Fi in JSON format from the devices within the E3 environment. The processed data by this FN is transmitted via Wi-Fi to the primary ARTIK FN in HL7 format.

Two Fog Devices. The first device is an Arduino managing a gas detection system in the environment, comprising a gas sensor and an alarm, communicating data via Bluetooth in JSON format. The Arduino sends the collected data via Wi-Fi in JSON format to the FN within the E3 environment. The second device is a smartphone that monitors patient activity within the E3 room, transmitting data via Wi-Fi in JSON format to the FN and directly to the central router in the M1 environment via Wi-Fi in HL7 data format.

Furthermore, among the various needs and requirements of this AAL scenario, the following characteristics are notable:

The geriatric center has a system administrator user responsible for monitoring all environments.

A head doctor at the geriatric center can access to the central FN to monitor all the data generated in the AAL.

Each sub-environment (i.e., E1, E2, E3) is accessible to a doctor who can view data from the respective FN.

The fog devices monitoring vital signs (i.e., ECG, blood pressure, oxygen saturation) or activity (i.e., intelligent pillbox, smartwatch, smartphone) belong to a patient.

The Intelligent Pillbox [62], not only monitors patient medication tracking but also reports this activity to a nurse at the geriatric center.

AAL and Network Architecture Design:

Figure 6 presents the AAL architecture designed using the FOGAAL DSL based on the specified requirements. The tool palette elements comprehensively model the architecture, with each link configured with distinct data formats and communication types. The HL7 format, ideal for healthcare applications [58], [59], was chosen to consolidate the information on this AAL scenario. Roles like doctors, administrators, and patients are linked to corresponding elements in the architecture. FOGAAL effectively demonstrates the core features of AAL architecture with FC, representing various environments and their unique features, including sensor heterogeneity and the interoperability requirements between different devices. The key advantages of using this tool include:

No advanced knowledge of AAL environments or FC architectural specifications is required.

It enables developers to design AAL architectures based on FC capabilities while abstracting the IoT devices’ heterogeneity. It offers the flexibility to choose different communication protocols and data exchange standards easily and transparently.

It allows the generation of AAL environments tailored to the specific needs of each user within the system.

SECTION V.Empirical Evaluation of FOGAAL
Empirical evaluations related to usability are necessary for studies focusing on developing DSLs. Then, empirical assessment of new solutions is crucial for understanding the behavior and perception of end-users [64], [65]. Therefore, this section presents an empirical validation to assess end users’ perceptions of the FOGAAL DSL tool’s ease of use, usefulness, and intention to use it for modeling AAL architectures with FC capabilities in a proposed AAL scenario. The following paragraphs will describe the fundamentals of the controlled quasi-experiment conducted and present its results.

A. Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)
The evaluation, conducted via a quasi-experiment, aims to predict the acceptance and adoption of FOGAAL DSL by end-users. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), as proposed by Davis [50], serves as the framework for assessing user perceptions, which are considered the primary determinants of their attitudes toward this new technology. These attitudes subsequently influence intentions, thereby impacting behavior. In this context, TAM usage is represented as a direct function of intention, as illustrated in Fig. 7. The primary constructs presented by TAM are described below:

FIGURE 7. - TAM constructors.
FIGURE 7.
TAM constructors.

Show All

Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU). The degree to which users expect the target system to be effortless.

Perceived Usefulness (PU). The subjective probability of the user that using a specific application could increase their performance in an activity.

Attitude (A). The desire of the user to use the proposed system. PU and PEOU predict the attitude towards using the system or technological solution.

Behavioral Intention to Use (ITU). The measure of resistance to execute a specific behavior. A and PU influence the individual’s ITU to use the system or technological solution.

Use: The use represents the current usage of the system. ITU predicts the use.

B. Design of the Quasi-Experiment
The first step is to design the quasi-experiment for application to end-users. This design is divided into the following tasks: i) defining the goals and research questions of the quasi-experiment; ii) establishing hypotheses to be tested based on the perception variables or constructs of the TAM; iii) adapting the questionnaire to measure the perception variables of the TAM in the context of FOGAAL; and iv) defining the experimental scenario, tasks, and materials for the quasi-experiment to be performed by the end-users.

1) Goal and Research Questions
Initially, it is essential to clarify what the quasi-experiment will evaluate. In this sense, the goal of the quasi-experiment is formulated following the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) framework proposed by Solingen et al. [66] (See Table 3).

TABLE 3 Goal-Question-Metric for the Quasi-Experiment
Table 3- Goal-Question-Metric for the Quasi-Experiment
Additionally, the research questions were defined based on the TAM’s perception variables or constructors (See Table 4).

TABLE 4 Research Questions for the Quasi-Experiment
Table 4- Research Questions for the Quasi-Experiment
2) Hypotheses
The hypotheses must enable the evaluation of the research questions. Therefore, according to the questions defined in Table 4, the hypotheses are stated in Table 5. Hypotheses H10 , H20 , and H40 allow for studying the first question, while hypotheses H30 , H50 the second question. The evaluation process involves negating each hypothesis, which implicitly contains the TAM perception variables (PEOU, PU, ITU).

TABLE 5 Hypotheses for the Experiment
Table 5- Hypotheses for the Experiment
3) Questionnaire to Measure TAM Perception Variables
Table 6 presents the adapted questionnaire to measure the TAM perception variables in FOGAAL, as follows:

Fourteen questions were answered on a Likert scale of 1 to 5 points (3 as a neutral value). Respondents will use this scale to accept or reject the technological solution.

The questionnaire comprises five questions addressing PEOU, six focusing on PU, and three regarding to ITU.

Additionally, two open-ended questions are included in the questionnaire to gather participant observations regarding the technological solution.

TABLE 6 Questionnaire Adapted to FOGAAL DSL
Table 6- Questionnaire Adapted to FOGAAL DSL
4) Experimental Tasks and Materials
The quasi-experiment tasks followed the proposed process for designing AAL architectures using FOGAAL DSL, as presented in Section IV. This process, depicted in Fig. 4, enabled researchers to better explain the use of the FOGAAL tool by following a coherent sequence of steps. This improvement facilitated participants’ understanding during both the training and execution phases of the experiment.

The quasi-experimental instrumentation, which included documentation, the software necessary for the experimental tasks, and a questionnaire to measure participants’ perceptions, were all accessed by the participants via a dedicated website. The documentation comprised: i) a presentation used by researchers to train participants on technical concepts related to FOGAAL, ii) a guide describing the process for designing AAL architectures using FOGAAL, and iii) Participants were provided with a worksheet detailing the experimental scenario exercise, which involved designing an AAL center for children with special needs (See Fig 8). The scenario included three sub-environments: a physiotherapy room, an early stimulation room, and a room for children with autism, each with specific requirements and elements like nodes, sensors, and smart devices [67], [68], [69], [70].

C. Execution of the Quasi-Experiment
The quasi-experiment involved thirty software engineers. Each individual was provided with a dedicated computer in a computing laboratory, equipped with all necessary software and documents for the experiment. The session, scheduled for two hours, was divided into two stages.

During the first hour, a class that covered foundational concepts like Ambient Intelligence (AmI), AAL, IoT, FC, and DSLs. Next, the FOGAAL DSL tool, including its metamodel, design environment, and tools palette, was presented. Then, the AAL scenario of Section IV (see Fig. 6) was shown to participants as a demonstration exercise of the tool use.

The second hour started with an overview of the AAL scenario to be developed by the participants (See Fig. 8). Participants then designed the scenario using FOGAAL, following the process in Fig. 4. The tasks were timed: 10 minutes for gathering system requirements, 15 minutes for diagramming hardware components with FOGAAL, and a final 10 minutes for completing the survey (see Table 6).

D. Results of the Quasi-Experiment
This subsection elaborates on the results of the performed quasi-experiment concerning the TAM perception variables (e.g., PEOU, PU, ITU) and the corresponding hypothesis tests. Descriptive statistics, box plots, and statistical tests describe and analyze the collected data. The results were obtained using IBM’s SPSS v2.0 software. As recommended by Moody [71], significance levels were utilized to determine whether to accept or reject the hypotheses.

1) Analysis of the User Perception
Fig. 9 displays the box plots for the perception variables. It is evident that the mean of each variable exceeds the Likert neutral value (i.e., 3). Also, the box plots reveal outliers (participants with id =5, 12, 14, 19, and 20), which were excluded to prevent distortions in subsequent statistical analyses.

Table 7 summarizes the descriptive statistics of the TAM perception variables. In addition, it includes in the penultimate column the results of the Shapiro-Wilk test to check whether the perception variables have a normal distribution and determine the test type to contrast the null hypotheses H10, H20, and H30. In this sense, for the PEOU and PU variables, which have a normal distribution (p>0.05), the hypothesis has been tested by applying the one-tailed t-test. In contrast, for the UTI variable, which does not have a normal distribution (p<0.05), the Wilcoxon one-tailed one-sample test was applied with a test value equal to three since it corresponds to the Likert scale neutral of the questionnaire.

The applied test results are presented in the last column of Table 7. These results indicate the rejection of the null hypotheses H10, H20, and H30. This rejection suggests that the participants perceive the FOGAAL DSL as easy to use and useful and are inclined to consider using this tool in the future for designing AAL architecture based on FC.

2) Analysis of Causal Relationships
In this section, the TAM’s structural aspect is validated in terms of the causal relationships between its perception variables. For this, the simple linear regression method has been used since the hypotheses to be tested (H40, H50, and H60) are causal relationships between continuous variables. The results of each of the causal relationships are presented below:

Perceived Ease of Use vs Perceived Usefulness. The simple linear regression model built to test hypothesis H4 has ease of use (PEOU) as the independent variable (predictor) and usefulness (PU) as the dependent variable (predicted). The resulting regression equation is:
PU=3.185+0.256∗PEOU(1)
View SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.The regression model was found not to be significant, with p>0.1 (see Table 8). Furthermore, the R2 statistic shows that the PEOU variable can explain only 9%.

Perceived Ease of Use vs Intention to Use. The simple linear regression model constructed to test hypothesis H5 employs ease of use (PEOU) as the predictor and intention to use (ITU) as the outcome. The resulting regression equation is:
ITU=4.274+0.094∗PEOU(2)
View SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.The regression model was found to be non-significant, with p>0.1 (see Table 9). Furthermore, the R2 statistic indicates that the PEOU variable can only explain 1.8% of the ITU variance, suggesting that PEOU does not significantly influence participants’ future ITU. Therefore, these results do not warrant rejecting H5 and accepting its alternative hypothesis. Thus, it is empirically confirmed that PEOU does not determine the ITU.

Perceived Usefulness vs Intention to Use. The simple linear regression model was constructed to examine hypothesis H6, with usefulness (PU) serving as the independent variable (predictor) and intention to use (ITU) as the dependent variable (predicted). The resulting regression equation is presented as follows.
ITU=3.018+0.388∗PU(3)
View SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.The regression model was found to be insignificant, with p <0.05 (refer to Table 10). Additionally, the R2 statistic indicates that the PU variable accounts for only 22.7% of the variance in ITU, suggesting that the perceived usefulness by participants has a limited influence on their intention to use the tool. These findings lead to the rejection of H6 and acceptance of its alternative hypothesis, indicating that PU does indeed affect ITU.

E. Discussion
Based on the results from the quasi-experiment, the following general conclusions are drawn for each research question (e.g., RQ1, RQ2):

RQ1: “Is the FOGAAL DSL perceived as easy to use and useful?” Through the evaluation, alternative hypotheses H1 and H2 are accepted. This provides support to determine that most participants have found FOGAAL DSL easy to use and useful when designing architectures for AAL environments with FC support. Furthermore, it has been shown that there is no influence between users’ perception of ease of use and perceived usefulness, as indicated by the rejection of alternative hypothesis H4.

RQ2: “Is there the intention to use the FOGAAL DSL in the future? If so, is the intention to use the result of the user perception?” Likewise, through the quasi-experiment, alternative hypothesis H3 is accepted. Consequently, this indicates the participants’ interest in using FOGAAL in future projects with similar architecture requirements. Furthermore, alternative hypothesis H5 has been rejected, while H6 has been accepted. Therefore, it has been determined that the influence on the intention to use does not depend on ease of use but only partially on perceived usefulness.

Fig. 10 summarizes the results of the empirical evaluation of FOGAAL with TAM support. Overall, these results motivate us to continue improving and scaling the FOGAAL tool to a more accurate and refined version.

F. Threats to the Validity of the Quasi-Experiment
This subsection thoroughly examines potential threats that could impact the validity of the evaluation results. These threats have been meticulously organized in alignment with the comprehensive classification proposed by Cook and Campbell [72].

1) Internal Validity
The main threats mitigated in this category were participants’ experience, researchers’ biases, biases related to the experimental material, and the FOGAAL DSL tool. To reduce the threat associated with participants’ experiences, a pre-training exercise was conducted using the FOGAAL tool. Additionally, a pilot test was carried out with the participation of experts to eliminate possible ambiguities and errors related to the experimental material and FOGAAL DSL.

2) External Validity
The primary threat to external validity lies in the representativeness of the results, which can be influenced by both the evaluation design and the context of the selected participants. To mitigate this concern, an AAL scenario was proposed, encompassing a comprehensive and diverse set of requirements for implementation, thereby reducing the risk associated with the evaluation design. Additionally, the experiment involved software engineers with backgrounds in Software Architecture, Model-Driven Development, and IoT to address potential threats stemming from participant context.

3) Construct Validity
The main threat in this category was the reliability of the questionnaire. To address this, a Cronbach’s alpha reliability test was applied to each set of questions related to each perception variable. The test results exceeded the minimum acceptance threshold of α=0.70 , with Cronbach’s alpha values of 0.759 for PEOU, 0.795 for PU, and 0.707 for ITU.

4) Conclusion Validity
One of the primary validity concerns regarding the conclusion is the sample size of the quasi-experiment. As mentioned, a homogeneous group of participants was selected to mitigate this risk. Moreover, measures were taken to ensure that each dependent variable was calculated using the same procedure.

SECTION VI.FOGAAL Advantages and Limitations
This section outlines the advantages and areas for improvement of the FOGAAL DSL. Analyzing its strengths and limitations provides a perspective on its benefits and the next steps toward perfecting this tool. This discussion will help stakeholders understand the current capabilities and challenges of the FOGAAL DSL, guiding its application and evolution.

A. Advantages
FOGAAL is a novel contribution both in the FC domain and in AAL and healthcare, as it provides several improvements to the synergy of these areas, including:

Domain-Specific Characterization. FOGAAL is designed explicitly for AAL environments, ensuring that its features and functionalities are directly aligned with the requirements proper of AAL domain. Also, it includes a complete semantic related to the AAL domain that specifies network and infrastructure aspects. Consequently, with this high abstraction level, domain experts can easily use the tool to create solutions in this context.

Interoperability. This DSL promotes interoperability among several solutions that will use this tool. Thus, FOGAAL provides a common language and data formats that software and hardware architects and developers can use when creating their specific solutions. It also supports integrating heterogeneous devices and sensors through its standardized parameters that are aligned with established standards.

Scalability. As a MDE solution, the DSL is extensible and scalable, which enhances maintenance. The metamodel on which the tool is based allows for easy evolution and inclusion of new elements. Additionally, FOGAAL’s features support scalable deployment across various AAL scenarios, making it adaptable to different implementation scales, from homes to more extensive healthcare facilities.

Alignment to standards. FOGAAL’s alignment with standards such as the NIST conceptual model ensures interoperability, enabling seamless integration with various systems, devices, and services within the AAL-FC ecosystem. Also, FOGAAL includes elements addressed by SOPRANO, a well-known ontology in the AAL scope; these aspects provide consistency in elements, links, and interrelationships. Being aligned to standards and ontologies, FOGAAL enhances reliability, coherence, interoperability, and learnability, among other quality characteristics that reduce errors when creating AAL solutions. Moreover, aligning with standards future-proofs FOGAAL, maintaining its relevance in the evolving tech landscape. This boosts credibility, gaining support from healthcare providers, regulators, and funding agencies. Standardization also cuts costs by streamlining integration and reducing the need for custom development and maintenance.

Low cost of implementation. Since its creation, FOGAAL has required meager implementation costs. It has been built using free Eclipse Modeling Tools, which has made its licensing cost practically nonexistent. Although it has required a reasonably intense effort on the part of the tool’s designer and programmer, this cost is a one-time thing, given that, as it is a solution based on model-driven software engineering, it needs to be built only once, and changes do not entail a high cost. Thus, once deployed, it does not generate costs; on the contrary, the advantages are significant for software and hardware architects who build AAL environments.

B. Limitations
Although FOGAAL DSL is enormously applicable at this stage of development, several increments can be implemented for future versions of the tool.

Include specific artifacts. While this DSL provides a high-level abstraction, several specific artifacts (e.g., feature-specific sensors and models) have not yet been included to allow specific solutions creation. Alternatives include developing a meta-model derived from various technologies, allowing specialization from particular needs or creating model-to-model transformations.

Code to text transformations. Transforming models into code will help generate deployable solutions, benefiting developers by eliminating the need to manually write the code based on the DSL.

Cost of implementation. The cost of implementing the solutions will be reduced by means of code generators, which, depending on the programming language, need to be developed only once, and then those artifacts will transform all the architectures designed by using FOGAAL directly to executable code.

Overall, the advantages above support the idea that FOGAAL distinguishes itself from other design tools and language specifications through its design for the AAL domain and its alignment with standards. Unlike general-purpose tools, which are broad in scope and often require significant customization, FOGAAL DSL is specifically tailored to meet its target domain’s unique needs and constraints. This specialization ensures FOGAAL achieves results that general-purpose tools cannot, providing several distinct advantages. However, further work will be considered to empower the tool in order to reduce the limitations gaps described.

SECTION VII.Conclusion and Further Work
This paper introduces FOGAAL, a DSL designed to facilitate the development of architectures for AAL, leveraging the benefits of Fog Computing. FOGAAL aims to streamline the adoption of individual components within the FC layer during architecture design. It achieves this by utilizing the SOPRANO ontology and adhering to the NIST Standard for FC, enabling its applicability to various architectural configurations. Moreover, FOGAAL demonstrates its feasibility and utility in modeling AAL architectures across multiple environments, addressing standardized language, interoperability, heterogeneity, and scalability issues.

Moreover, the positive evaluation results of FOGAAL through the TAM provide valuable insights for both the evaluated software engineers and the FOGAAL developers, emphasizing its usability, efficiency, and potential impact on architectural design practices where the FC paradigm empowers specific domains such as the AAL.

This proposal represents an initial step towards automating the generation of diverse architecture views for AAL environments based on user needs. Future endeavors should focus on refining the tool by extending the concept of infrastructure as code to manage scripts for version control systems, libraries for automated tests, and tools for integration and deployment. Furthermore, conducting new experiments and case studies in industrial environments using realistic scenarios will be crucial to assess other quality attributes of both FOGAAL itself (e.g., effectiveness, efficiency) and the architectures generated by it (e.g., performance, interoperability, flexibility, scalability, etc.). Additionally, these new evaluations will include control groups using other relevant DSLs in the domain. This will enable a more comprehensive and detailed comparative analysis of FOGAAL against other DSLs, then allowing to identify their strengths and somehow weaknesses in specific contexts.
